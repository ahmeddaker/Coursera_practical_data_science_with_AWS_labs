__label__0 "this shirt is cute . i like the pleated neck as it makes the top feminine while still casual . it is made of very soft fabric and drapes nicely . the only issue is that the seam/pleat that runs down the middle is off center . i think the fabric was cut incorrectly so the seam twists to one side after i have it on for a few minutes and move around . i keep having to twist it straight which is very annoying ."

( i usually wear a 28 or 29 and the 28 fit nicely through the hips and thighs . ) unfortunately the color is off- i thought they were going to be a dark midnight blue but they are actually gray . and they have a button-fly closure which causes the pants to protrude a bit in the area where no woman wants protrusion . i will be returning them ."

__label__0 "the positive : light-weight fabric interesting drape the negative : i 'm tall and would have preferred if it was longer . the big drawback is the ridiculous buttons -- three fell off the first time i wore it ... and it fits loosely ! they 're held on by a single loop ... ugh ."

__label__1 "i love this kimono ! the material and construction are beautiful but the one size fits all may be too big for a petite frame . you can throw it over the simplest outfit and make an instant glamour statement !"
__label__0 "i tried this on in the store and decided to order a larger size online . the fabric by the buttons is very thin so any pulling will cause tears the one i tried on in store was shredded by someone else trying it . i 'm a 34 dd and bought a 14. before trying it on i noticed the fabric is already pulling a little right out of the package . trying to decide if it is worth keeping or will be destroyed from wearing . it really is very cute on ."
__label__1 "the blush stripes are subtle but they definitely give elongating effect to your legs . very comfortable pair of crop pants but my calves are definitely feeling tight in there !"
__label__0 "this spandex top in my opinion is workout wear . it is not the tank i expected to receive but my bad . it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts . it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is it should fit like this . 5 ' 5 142 lbs medium is skin tight . color is nice but as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer . quality seems fair ."
__label__-1 "when i ordered this online i should have paid more attention to the picture . the dress comes to the knees of the 5'10 model . i was swimming in small petite size . i checked the label and wondered whether i received the wrong size . nope it was ps . either the dress was mislabeled or this is cut huge . returning . too bad because the shape and color are cute ."
__label__0 "loved the look quality was great but did n't work for me . too busy and off-fitting . i did return ."
__label__0 "skirt was too big in the wiast and too much fabric . was not flattering and generally not cute enough to warrent spending 50 $ to get it tailored . usual size oop felt atleast 2 sizes too large . the pattern on the skirt and the nuetral color is very nice . if you can find one that fits would be a nice 3 season skirt !"
__label__-1 "these are terribly unflattering the wash looks dirty and the rise is not 10.5 like the description says which is the only reason i gambled on these it is 13 ."
__label__0 "i ordered these hoping they would look like the model - but they did n't . i am small but curvy . it hugged too tightly in the hips so sadly these pants are going back ."
__label__0 "i lived the front and back designs but did n't like the fit ."
__label__0 "i hoped from the picture that this would be more of a straight down sort of fit . retailer is usually really great at selling tops that flatter hips without having an obvious bell shape to them . however the top had too much of a flare out bell-shaped vibe . i need to be able to wear this with maxi skirts in the summer but this top would be too sack-like and billowy with those . i think it would only work with jeans/trousers . my final objection was the arm holes - the way they are cut"
__label__-1 "i was so bummed by this dress ! i had high hopes when i ordered it but was surprised by the poor quality and cheap materials when it arrived . the body of the dress is unlined fleece material -- it reminded me of material that they make cheap halloween costumes out of . i found the fit baggy and unflattering . the shawl portion is only attached at the very top of the shoulders very disappointed . i already returned this ."
__label__0 "the dress is not like pictured . it is above the knee and sleeves are neither 3/4 nor full length-somewhere in between . i am 5 ' 4 112 lbs bought xs regular . had higher expectations for the price . going back to the store ."
__label__-1 "i am very disappointed with this order . the shirt looks and feels cheap is not flattering in any way . i am sending it back right away ."
__label__-1 "this is a gorgeous print but i found it too fussy for my taste . it is quite shapeless so i tried doing a half tuck . it looked cute for about 2 seconds but then i had to worry about keeping the shoulders down ."
__label__1 "this tee is so cute and well constructed . it 's not a fabric that 's going to wrinkle and pill eventually which i love . it runs tts and i like that it 's thin but not to sheer that i need a camisole - just a nude bra !"
__label__0 "short and wide . the color and print are so pretty but the shape is n't flattering at least not to me . might work better on a teen ?"
__label__0 "i practically live in lounge pants and i like the unique style of this wide-leg version . i 'm generally a 6/28 in pants and ordered the small which fit well if a bit big . the overall fit is great - slim at the hip with a nice wide waistband and flatteringly-placed dropped pockets . the pants really slim my hips and provide a nice silhouette with the wide legs . the fabric is soft and flows and i did not experience any sheerness . as for color - i would call these a deep cool brown definitely not"
__label__0 "i ordered an xl because most retailer button ups i need a 12 and sometime 14 due to my shoulders and chest but this was huge ."
__label__0 "just a warning the yoke on this dress has sequins underneath . i 'm not a sparkle kinda gal so as soon as i saw that the dress went right back in the package and will be going back to the store . i wish that had been described or more evident in the pictures to me it cheapens the whole dress which would otherwise be adorable ."
__label__-1 "this shirt appears nice in the pictures . it appears to have a bit of style . wrong . the shirt is one of the thinnest fabrics i 've ever purchased . i live in warmer climate and its nice to have different cotton shirts with some style . this shirt has no style and i thought it would . i have purchased this brand before and thought this fabric would be similar . the other shirts were way nicer softer and had a different level of construction . i wanted to wear this shirt out and when i put it on it w"
__label__0 "this dress is tricky . the fabric is very thin and the under slip it comes with runs small . i wear it with my yoga shorts underneath . the fabric is a very thin linen . my husband loves me in this dress so that a huge pro . its very light and cool perfect for the summer time ."
__label__-1 "i loved this dress when i saw it online perfect for a summer wedding but when i tried it on i was very disappointed . the fabric and styling are gorgeous and very high quality but the sheer amount of fabric on this dress is just not as pictured . there is layer after layer of silk and ruffle and while lovely it made me look very large . i tried tying the belt many ways to no avail . sadly it will have to go back . it may look good on a very thin frame but did n't complement my average one ."
__label__0 "this skirt was cute on but not particularly flattering . i thought the denim was a little too stiff . typically a-lines are flattering on my figure but this was a miss ."
__label__0 "love the shape of this top and often look to retailer for corset-style summer tops that are pretty . this top is made from a thick stiff fabric that does n't breathe . so my usual size xxs was too constricting . tried an xs also and it basically fit but i still was n't a fan of the very heavy fabric in a summer top . it 's almost like a neoprene . the colors are an odd choice and not my favorite either . i wanted to see in person and they just do n't cut it for me . would love in different colors and softer"
__label__0 "the concept of this top is edgy for a sweatshirt fabric . i think it works better on a thin frame instead of my curvy frame . although i appreciate the design it did not work for me ."
__label__-1 "quality is fantastic but i feel like a 14 would have barely made it 's way around one leg ! this pant is way small in terms of sizing and not a style fit for anyone over a 6. a lot of fabric in the legs . nice pant but not for this girl !"
__label__-1 "i was really excited to get this top in the mail ; unlike other reviewers i did n't find that the top fit small but i thought that the tight fit across the shoulders and chest did n't look good with the billow-y torso of the top . i think this top would be flattering on really thin girls but i 'm very tall and broad shouldered so it did n't look as good on me ."
__label__-1 "the shirt is absolutely cute looking . but that 's just that .... looks . i 'm 5 ' 2 size 6 & wears m to l top . i tried on the medium in the store it was rather flowing . i liked it . but i did n't like how it fit on the underarm area . it hung very low . so i ordered a petite m. still the same . plus the store the lighting was dark so i did n't realize how see through the shirt was too . had to return it ."
__label__-1 "so i bought this even after seeing the other reviews . because i love the designer and their things are normally cute and different . this fits just as others describe . it was not flattering to me at all 52. had to go back ."
__label__-1 "my personal opinion is that i am not a fan of this top the material of the fabric does n't seem as nice as delettas other tops and it had a really boxy fit on me . i wanted to love this top but i did not ."
__label__0 "this is a very pretty color . loved the flow and the length of this top . however the neck hole seemed too small for the top . all the embroidering is at the neck and makes that part very stiff . going back"
__label__1 "thin for this late in the season but the colors are so pretty . i 'm going to layer it over a long sleeve t top with a cardi and pair with leggings . runs large . love the the unconnected slip . 5 stars ."
__label__-1 "this shirt is so small . i am not sure who came up with the sizing but you have to go up several sizes to get a comfortable fit . do n't waste your time on this shirt . such a shame it could have been very cute ."
__label__0 "i really really wanted to take this home with me but decided against it . from the front this dress looks amazing when it was belted and i love the colors in it . however it bunched like crazy in the back . i tried it without the belting and it just hung like a sack and was completely unflattering . if there were some way to get rid of the bunching in the back then i would have taken it home . but with the cost of the dress i ca n't justify taking it to a tailor so it stayed . sigh . so close ."
__label__1 "snap this one up but make sure you order a size larger than your normal size . it runs a full size too small . it sold out before and i was told it was n't coming back in . i had purchased one previously in my regular size but it was too small . to my delight it 's back and i 've purchased one in the next size up . it 's well made can go from business to sport to casual ."
__label__-1 "this top looks great on the model -- a petite frame small-busted body . i am 5 ' 2 and have a large bust and curvy hips . this top hit in all the wrong places . the front looks very cropped and frumpy if you have a large bust . the width of the top of very boxy . the top is very soft and comfortable and the color is pretty ."
__label__1 "the red detail at the shoulders is pretty and i liked the contrast between the red and white . the fabric is soft and comfortable . it is a sweater knit fabric more substantial than you might guess from photos . the sleeve ruffles were a little poofy for me and combined with the loose fit it made me feel a little too girl-ish . this could work for you if you are looking for a peasant style blouse with a forgiving shape and nice details but it was n't quite right for me ."
__label__-1 "does n't feel like cotton jersey . feels like a thin version of the seamless cami . it 's not soft as i expected . it 's much thinner than expected too ."
__label__-1 "i received this top in the mail today not what i expected at all ! it is a great fabric just way too much of it . it is proportionally incorrect width wise . unfortunately this one will be going back ."
__label__1 "love this dress ! ! ! i agree with the other reviewers i had to size up one size but then it was perfect . i 'm 5 ' 5 125 lbs . and the size 6 worked great ."
__label__1 "this is a very stylish cardigan but it runs small . i usually take a small but i took a medium in this . for reference i am 130 lbs chest 36c . i fell so in love with it once i put it on but you have to watch for snags as it is extremely delicate . got the 20 % off today and could n't be happier with this purchase ."
__label__0 "i 'm 5 ' 7 125lbs and the small fits perfectly . the sleeves are the right length ( i have long arms and legs ) and the body fits loosely without looking sloppy . at my height the small is not long enough to wear as a tunic which is fine . unfortunately the shirt arrived with makeup stains around the laces and the inside of the shirt so i had to wash it before wearing it . i only purchased this shirt because it was on sale ."
__label__0 "i 've had my eye on this for a while . went into my local retailer to try it on . tried on s and xs . it fit the same not much different . the color is great . will go with so many things however i have a larger bust 34d-dd and am short wasted generally wearing petite in skirts because of it . it sort of belled at the bottom peplumish which made it look like my bust drooped to my waste . not flattering on me . i 'm 5'3ish 118 # and generally wear 4 in tops . it felt like it would stretch out as the day"
__label__-1 "this is a pretty dress but the cut is quite boxy . i had thought that the dress would cut in a bit along the body and then flare out more around the waist down to the hem ; however the dress is baggy from the sleeves all the way down which lends to a rather unflattering look ."
__label__0 "this is a nice choice for holiday gatherings . i like that the length grazes the knee so it is conservative enough for office related gatherings . the size small fit me well - i am usually a size 2/4 with a small bust . in my opinion it runs small and those with larger busts will definitely have to size up ( but then perhaps the waist will be too big ) . the problem with this dress is the quality . the fabrics are terrible . the delicate netting type fabric on the top layer of skirt got stuck in the zip"
__label__0 "about a month ago i purchased the pilcro hypen chinos in moss size 28 petite . i loved the color and fit so much that when i saw free shipping being offered i decided to get another pair . this time i ordered the color ? pink ? and of course size 28 petite . well the color really isn ? t pink and unlike the moss color it does not look the color online . the color is more like salmon or apricot definitely not pink . what bothered me more is the fit . this pair was too big . it ? s mind-boggling why the sizing"
__label__1 "i love this tank ! its something you can dress up with a skirt or wear over jeans . i like loose fitting tops although i have a slender frame . this is also so comfortable . i went with a size medium and it fits perfect ."
__label__0 "cute design for a casual top . however it was a little snug on the bust for a medium . i returned it"
__label__0 "i like what they were going for here and the fabric . but it falls short in that i ca n't wear it to work -- -the back keyhole is massive so i ca n't wear my normal bras and the very wide neck also shows bra straps so unless i want to go with a strapless bra it 's not useful for me . i want to feel loose and soft and summer comfy and my strapless bras are anything but that . i 'd go without but that is a no-no where i work . i may try getting a size smaller . i wear a med . and i got a small and mayb"
__label__0 "i bought three of these this summer -- a mint ivory and yellow . when i received them they looked nice enough in person . i liked the heart motif and the peplum . the problem is the knit was on the cheap side and stretched out . the arms were tighter than i liked but loosened up through the day . but then the look became more matronly . i wish they had been 3/4 length or a vest . the cheap outstretched look just did n't work . i ended up donating all of mine after a few wears . they also pilled conside"
__label__-1 "i have to agree that the fit is unfortunate . i am using a size 2 in retailer and most dresses . i knew to size up based on reviews here . i tried the size 4 and i could barely button the top . the waist fit fine and the underarms was fitted nicely to the body . i sized up to a size 6 and the dress was oversized in the top with gaping armholes . too bad because the color is beautiful and the style is adorable ."
__label__1 "like other reviewers i 'm glad i sized down . this is a cute tunic that is definitely great quality lightweight chambray . i love that it has pockets but they do puff a bit at my hips ."
__label__-1 "sooo disappointed with how flimsy this fabric is . i think this is the thinnest of all clothing items i have ever come across anywhere in my life . this is really a shame because the colors are stunning and it is a nice shirt style . another con is if you have any bit of back fat it shows every lump and bump . i do not recommend unless you have a lean back and the cost was $ 5.00 ! ! !"
__label__1 "do n't detach the collar unless you like getting frustrated . i made the mistake of taking it off just to see what it looks like without it ( cute ) but reattaching was the biggest pain ! i have pretty nimble fingers but stretching the little loops around the little buttons tested my patience to the limit . so other than that -- buy this sweater if you get a chance . it 's stylish flattering soft versatile etc etc ..."
__label__1 "i just received the top today and will send back for a larger size . i am i between a 4 and 6 so tried the 4 thinking it would be boxy . it is very fitted with no opening to assist in pulling over shoulders . i am hoping the 6 is only slightly bigger . the shirt also had a slight musty odor . it 's a rather thin chambray .... with 3/4 sleeves . the top came to just the top of my jeans which should work for higher waisted skirts or layering ."
__label__0 "i ordered this sweater in green in petite large . the color and knit is beautiful and the shoulders and body fit comfortably ; however the sleeves were very long for a petite . i roll them and it looks okay but would have rather had a normal petite length sleeve ."
__label__1 "was hopeful this might work on my petite pear shape ( i am 5 ' probably 135-140lb ; one to two sizes larger on the bottom ) when i first saw online so went to store to give the regular size a trial run before ordering the petite size online . you can never tell with these flare dresses - some just make the hips look so much worse and have n't had a lot of luck with casual retailer flare dresses this season . first tried on the medium and fell in love instantly - was looking a little big but thought orde"
__label__0 "wow this runs small ! i 'm thinking the accidentally sent me an xxs ? ! ?"
__label__1 "the colors and textures on this top are fun . however the boxy shape is n't very flattering and poofs out a bit around the belly . maybe it would look a bit more feminine on someone with a curvier chest . i would size up if between sizes because the top part around the arms is not very roomy . i tried it on at the store but decided to pass because the xs was a little tight around the arms but the s billowed around the belly too much . still a cute piece if it works for you fit-wise ."
__label__0 "i really liked the fabric and the design of this sweater but the sleeves hung at an odd length ( no way to push them up like on the model ) and the sweater was large on me . i have broad shoulders but am otherwise petite . unfortunately i had to return this . glad others are having better luck ."
__label__-1 "i loved the cut and the stretch in the material made them comfortable however i found that the material was unflattering for thicker thighs because it tended to cling to the body . it would have been better with some sort of lining as it would have prevented the flimsy material from highlighting imperfections . bottom of pants are not hemmed so if you want a clean look you may not like the edges . these were returned immediately as it just did not work for me ."
__label__-1 "really disappointing quality . these jeans are of a very poor quality material and developed holes in the inseams after only a month ! i love pilcros and am totally shocked at the poor quality ... retailer i hope this is just a fluke . not worth the money !"
__label__-1 "this dress had beautiful details and the material was better than i expected ; however it was huge ! it completed swallowed me . i am 5 ' 1 about 106 pounds with quite a bit of muscle . i ordered a 00p and it still looked like a sack ."
__label__-1 "these are my all time comfiest shorts and i am obsessed with the lavender color . sadly using free and clear detergent on a cold delicate cycle made the color turn splotchy and they are unwearable . this happened once and i exchanged for another pair but i 'll be returning this pair . i 'll be sad to see my favorite color go but there is obviously a defect in the dye used . maybe i 'll try another color !"
__label__0 "i ordered this in white . the material is similar to a polo shirt which i had n't counted on . it was also on the large size and just unflattering on me . still the quality seemed to be good ."
__label__1 "i am 5 ' 4 170lbs 34dd and a medium fits beautifully in this top . the mint green is very pretty and a nude bra under it works without showing and without it being see-thru . it is super soft and pretty and does n't cling . i love it !"
__label__1 "from the online pics i would never think to try this on but i was looking for a shirtdress with pockets so glad i did ! i purchased in green and navy ... i love the neck line when buttoned up almost military jacket'ish and i like the idea of wearing over jeans and a shirt and leaving unbuttoned almost like a light layer or jacket . super soft material ... i purchased a size 6 and i am 5 ' 9 and 140 lbs ."
__label__-1 "quality jumpsuit but poor design . the green made me look a bit like gumby the cartoon character"
__label__0 "but-the problem is i can not get the color to stay below the shoulders . the large appeal of this top is the over the shoulder look-but in just trying it on it would pop off the shoulders and make a cowl neck kind of top that did n't lay right . if it would have stayed it would have been a real win for me . i like the quality of the fabric and the longs sleeves but i ca n't get the desired look to work out so this is going back ."
__label__-1 "long-time ag jeans fan . lately though i 'm finding the material is much too stretchy . i wanted a good pair of jeans . if i wanted pajama jeans i would 've ordered them . i found the same thing with the prima jeans i ordered ( same review there ) . so back both pairs went . it 's a shame because the color was as pictured and just what i wanted . if only they had been made out of actual jeans material ."
__label__-1 "ordered a l and xl the sleeves were so tight on both sizes but the rest of the shirt was wide and loose . the tight sleeves were not proportional with the rest of the shirt . both sizes had to be returned ."
__label__-1 "when i saw this top online i thought i 'd love it and immediately ordered it in both colors . they arrived today and i am soooo disappointed . i have never seen such drab colors . the blue is a muddy grayish hue ( like an overcast day ) and the pink is a dusty shade of peach . yuck . and i was hoping the ruffle at the bottom would have a chiffon-like flowy effect . instead the ruffle is made of a cheap looking knit . back these go ..."
__label__-1 "i have been looking for a nice white tunic and i should have known when i saw this was one size fits all . maybe because i am petite ( 5 ' 2 ) but there was so much material hanging everywhere that it made me look even shorter and fat . who wants that ? so sending it back ."
__label__0 "wanted to love this dress as it 's perfect for transition . i 'm a curvy gal who usually sports an xl in dresses at retailer and unfortunately this one was way too big even for me to pull off . my boyfriend actually guffawed when he saw me in it . i would implore the maker to try this style again as it 's a good one unfortunately the sizing was it 's downfall ."
__label__0 "i tried on this shirt in the small and the xxs - both were ridiculously wide . they were also both cut really short - the peplum basically started right below my boobs though the small was maybe a little bit longer than the eex . the stripes are really cute the cut is just very strange . for reference the black and white is the small the taupe is the xxs ."
__label__0 "this dress has great potential . i happen to have a longer torso so the fit was off . as a previous review stated it 's short waisted and a lot a skirt which i agree the hem is also funky . i am still deciding if i want to keep it but if i do i plan on altering the skirt to be narrower and hemming it a bit shorter too . for reference i 'm 5 ' 3 and weigh 110 and i purchased a size 0 ."
__label__0 "i love this fabric and the design details of this top . but i am only 5 ' 3 and this top ends above my waist ! shoulders and sleeves fit perfectly and the neck and back details are very flattering . i ended up keeping the shirt because i love the fabric so much but i am trying to find a way to wear this shirt with how short it is . tucking in or wearing with high-waisted bottoms are all i can figure out for someone without a perfectly flat tummy ."
__label__1 "love the colors ! love the stripes ! great shape ! great style ! but ... i am normally a 12 on top ... and this pulled across my back ... so i have it in for an exchange for a 14. sometimes i have to do that ... i have a broad back . we will see how it fits ! but what an adorable shirt !"
__label__0 "i ordered this dress when it was briefly on sale with an extra percent off . i was very excited to receive it in my usual size large and wear with a jean jacket and cowboy boots . when i took it out of the package i could tell it looked really small . i did n't even try it on . i had my daughter who wears a size small try it on and she could n't even get it over her hips . if you are tall and thin like the model it will work for you . it is made of cupro looks exactly like the photo the color is g"
__label__1 "i think it 's a little on the long side and the sleeves are a little tight but otherwise i really like this jacket . it 's lightweight for summer and yet more stylish than the other long sleeve things i grab in case i get cold ."
__label__1 "this sweater has a retro feel to it . i like how it hits right at the hips and it 's not too long or not too short . it keeps you warm and it 's a nice alternative to all the drab sweaters that you would usually wear in the fall or winter ."
__label__0 "i ordered my normal size in this dress . i am 6 foot tall but the regular sizes were too large and too long ( mid-calf ) . i returned the dress for a size smaller in petite for a more flattering hemline . the dress is lovely especially on the models in the pictures but did n't quite work out for me . also it feels like there are hundreds of closure hooks that make putting on/taking off the dress seem to take an unusually long time !"
__label__-1 "the color is a nice cool red and the material is very soft . but the dress left me feeling shapeless and the bell sleeve overtook it . i wanted to love it but it just was n't working for me . i 'm 5 ' 8 and purchased a s. it fits true to size however it was loose around the waist and just was n't complimentary on me . this will have to go back ."
__label__-1 "after readying the reviews of this dress i thought for sure i was purchasing a winner . boy was i wrong ! first this dress feels like a potato sack and looked like one on . i felt that it was very boxy and more of a o ' one size fits all ' sizing . it did not embrace my curves at all . the material was not as chic as i would have thought . overall the entire dress was not flattering . honestly i do not understand what the rave reviews were talking about it ."
__label__1 "oh my gosh do i love this jumpsuit . i am so glad that i bought it . it is beautiful and fits perfectly . classy and beautiful and made in the perfect color . the design is slimming as well.there is nothing that i would change about it . i may be wearing this for my 60th birthday this month and am sure i will be getting it out for other occasions in the future . i love it ."
__label__0 "i loved the pattern color and mock turtleneck style of this top but it was just too short on me . i purchased the xs in the ivory color ( i am 5 ' 5 32d 110 lbs for reference ) . i had planned to layer this under jackets for work but every time i raised my arms you could see my stomach . i would not have felt comfortable wearing it to work because of this . the fit was slightly boxy also and it was not flattering when i tucked it into a skirt because the boxy shape caused the shirt to bunch up s"
__label__1 "i love the beading at the neck of this top and also the half-length banded sleeves . it is a dressy top that is nevertheless very comfortable to wear . it looks like silk although it is synthetic . i do wish it came in a petite length because it is a bit long for me but it is one of those pieces you can just put on over a variety of pants or skirts and you 're done and ready for work or going out to an event . it requires little in the way of accessories because the beading at the neck acts as built"
__label__0 "i wanted to love this top so badly . between the beautiful photos and the good reviews i did n't think i could go wrong with it . unfortunately it just did n't look great on . the bust area sagged on my smaller chest and then the top flared way out from the waist down . it does n't lay even remotely flat like the photos would have you believe . maybe this would look better on hourglass or slim types . the quality does appear to be good -- the material is weighty and soft ."
__label__-1 "got this in wine very pretty and soft . but so sheer even with the dark color one would have to wear a cami . returning for this reason . having to wear a cami wrecks the otw ultra-comfort ."
__label__1 "this is seriously a beautiful dress . it has such gorgeous colors . it 's lined so no slip needed . it is flowy and just the right length . i went with a petite and it is perfect .. ca n't wait to use it at the beach ."
__label__-1 "the fabric and cut of this blouse are beautiful but the v was so deep i could never wear it without a cami and i think that would ruin the look . i have a large chest but the similarly cut blouse ( without the textured fabric - from the same designer ) fit me fine . this one is just cut differently . i even tried sizing up and down - to no avail . the photo on the model seems misleading because i do n't see how the neck would lay flat or stay that high on anyone - even with a smaller chest . i was so"

__label__0 "i love the design and color of this cardigan and the way it was styled in the store display made me snatch one up right away . but unfortunately it 's huge and shapeless ( i tried size xs/s ) and i 'm a waif ( 5 ' 2 105 # ) - i think it could drape nicely on a tall woman but if you are small to average in height it 'll hang down somewhere mid-thigh or even lower . you can snug up the ties as they are threaded through the cardigan like a drawstring but that just made it look bunchy and even more shapel"

__label__1 "i loved the print on both but first bought the blue to check out the fit and feel . i went ahead and ordered the cat one today . the fit is relaxed and slightly oversized so if you want a slimmer or less boxy fit size down . for myself m was perfect since i 'm built larger and broader on top . the top is a bit long covers my hips and some of my bottom . it 's a mixed fabric design so the linen part may feel scratchy to sensitive types ."

__label__1 "i liked this top a lot when i saw it at the store - the cotton is soft and comfortable the colors are good ( i tried on the white charcoal and light aqua blue ) and the asymmetrical edge really makes it . the subtle ruffle detail at the edge combined with the pieced asymmetrical hem takes it from a classic tee to a contemporary style . however my store does n't have petite sizes and the regular size hit me at a point in the hip that was n't super-flattering on me ( at 5 ' 1 ) . it imay be an excelle"

__label__1 "i have been eyeing this top for a couple weeks and finally found it in my store . it was a good sign when i saw our stores in-house stylist wearing it ! i absolutely love the fit -- it 's soft and stretchy and fabric is nice quality . i 'm typically a medium sometimes large -- i bought the medium and it 's perfect . i could have gone down to a small as well . the large was way too big ( for reference i 'm 5 ' 8 athletic 150lbs ) . this top is going to take me everywhere this summer ! worth a try !"

__label__1 "this is the most beautiful dress ever ! i 'm very short and petite with an hourglass figure and a rather large chest . this dress feels like it was made for me . i often have a difficult time finding a dress that flatters my figure and is slimming . i was shocked that it was even a little roomy in the chest . the cut is so beautiful and it is very well made . while the lining might be too short for tall girls being only 51 the lining is perfect . the length in the back is just a teeny bit too long so"
__label__0 "i wish i could keep this dress based on the pretty orange print and style but the fabric and details make this a return even on sale price : ( agree with previous reviews : bodice too tight neckline too high/chokes fabric is rough outer is poorly attached to liner so it poofs in weird areas . too bad ... so sad !"
__label__1 "saw this hanging in the store . it is cute front and back . it is flattering as well . i plan to wear under a jacket for work and without a jacket at night . looks amazing with a denim jacket"
__label__1 "this is nicer than the first reviewer states . the fabric feels very soft and the tunic does not look cheap.the top of the tunic was a little more fitted so it was a little tight for me since i have wide shoulders . i will have to get a larger size ."
__label__0 "i really had high hopes for this dress . i had several issues with it though based on the high ratings other customers did not experience the same problems . 1- it was to short . i am 5 ' 8 and it was really really short on me . i could not sit down in it . 2- i found that it ran large . i 've lost some weight recently so perhaps i 've gone down a size but the medium was like a sack on me . 3-the waist was really roomy . it ballooned out to the point that it was comical . 4- as others have noted"

__label__1 "true to size so great fit from top to bottom . i am 5 ' 5 '' and it hits my hips at just the right spot - not too high or too low . it also does not flare out too much so it will not give off the impression that you have something to hide in the tummy area . it is very soft and comfortable . the material is not fragile so it should be easy to maintain its shape after washing ."
__label__-1 "matronly and unflattering . i think this may work on a very tall and slender body type ."
__label__-1 "these pants fit tts and are ask pictured in length on me ( 5 ' 5 ) . i can go between a 4 and a 6 and tried the 6 and they were fine . that said the fabric completed turned me off . it is that sort of stretch fabric with a sheen to it . i did not find them to be the wonderful wardrobe basic i thought they 'd be- the fabric is just too stiff and the sheen made them feel cheap unfortunately ."
__label__1 "i like the dress on line : color flowers cut etc . but when i tried it on it was just meh ... the color did wash me out a bit the flowers are still beautiful but the cut was n't as flattering on my body as it was on the model . 0p fit ok but i did n't keep it . you ahve to tie your own shoulder straps so adjustable i guess that is a plus . 115 lbs 30 dd 26.5 in waist"
__label__-1 "i bought this top in black . it is high quality material and i love the mock neck and zipper in back . however not only are the armholes are too large the shirt is cut too short . if i size down for smaller armholes it becomes a crop top not a flattering look for 50-something me . i really wanted this to work but alas it went back ."
__label__1 "i am obsessed with this shirt ! it 's sooooo comfy and soft like wearing a blanket ! perfect for throwing over yoga clothes . comfy yet adorable ."
__label__-1 "the tank looks nothing like the one pictured mainly because it 's tissue-paper thin . also i ordered it in two sizes - xs and s as it can be hard to tell which one will fit . i started with the xs and quickly discovered that it ran large . the armholes hit halfway to my waist . obviously i did n't even bother opening the size s. both will be returned ."
__label__1 "i purchased the teal/blue and the color is striking . though i put true to size the decorative top is slightly tight around the bust . and the bottom too is fitted and not flowy . for a looser fit you may want to size up . for a more fitted look it is true to size ."

__label__0 "really liked the fan pattern and the cut was cute and flattering . but the material is thin and all the edges are not finished and look frayed making the shirt look and feel cheap . would have kept if thicker material and the edges were finished . not worth full price"
__label__0 "i am normally a m-l ( 170 lbs 5 ' 4 34dd ) . i ordered this top in a medium knowing it ran big and it is huge . seriously i could wear it as a dress . i like the whole loose and comfy top thing but this is so massive it looks sloppy . i 'm going try and return it for a small . hey i like that i can wear a small ! the green color really is pretty and it 's so soft . just need a much smaller size ."

__label__-1 "but it runs super small . i wear a medium for everything but could n't come close to buttoning this . the buttons were about 4 inches apart ( horizontally ) probably should have ordered an extra large in order to fit . the quality and styling seemed great but ordering online requires truth in sizing"
__label__-1 "i hate to be so negative but i ca n't believe this shirt has so many positive reviews . it is stiff silver lace and hangs funny if you have a chest . adding a cami undnerneath makes it worse . looks cheap ."
__label__-1 "bought two of these because i loved the way they fit off of the rack . washed them according to directions and they were ruined . the material shrank up making the shirt short and boxy and the side panels ended up being rippled . definitely going to try to return these ."
__label__1 "i ordered this dress in size xl in the grey/red/yellow combination . i love everything about this dress . it 's comfortable . the colors are cheerful . the proportions of where the stripes are placed works . but i have to return this dress . it 's too short for what i 'm comfortable wearing . i saw from the photos that this comes mid-thigh on the taller models . i hoped that would mean it would be more knee-length for me . unfortunately it 's just too short and i 'd feel self-conscious . i do n't want to deal"

( who knew ? ! ) and like stated before it is super soft and comfortable . the only negative is that it is not physically attractive it is very baggy and it a-lines out . it 's fine its pajamas but if you are wanting something cute for bed and you have a straight body this may not be the answe"

__label__-1 "this looks great on the model but when it arrived i could n't believe it was the same jacket . it looks a bit like a really loose garbage bag on me and no amount of adjusting drawstrings is going to fix it . i really wanted to like it but even the xs/s was too baggy . also a bit worried based on other reviews that it is n't actually a rain jacket and wont keep you dry ."
__label__-1 "i have been looking for a fall/spring coat to wear when the weather is between 30 and 55 degrees . this coat looks great in the pictures but so disappointing in reality . the best thing i can say is that the fabric is soft . it is unlined so i 'm not sure why you 'd even wear it -- if the weather 's warm enough to wear a thin unlined jacket why not just wear a sweater ? the weight is not what i would expect at this price point . even worse the design is terrible ; my husband ( who has a great eye )"

__label__0 "it seems this coat could have been manufactured under a smaller spec size because the size large looses shape and where it hits on the waistline is unflattering . quality is high however"
__label__1 "i can not say enough good things about this dress . as a petite person ( 5 ' 0 ) it is so hard to find things that fit well without alterations but this dress fit perfectly . it 's also so well-made : the fabric is soft comfortable and gorgeously detailed and the dress is lined which makes it feel durable and gives the skirt some volume ( in a good flattering way ) ! i got it shortened by about 2 but this dress fits like a dream ."
__label__0 "the top is a pretty and has a nice pattern . it does run large and is it a bit billowy . i am 5 ' 4 petite and ordered a small ( maybe the xs would have been better ) . however the top swallowed me up and was unflattering . the colors are true to the picture .. not very bright but would be a nice transition to fall top . the feel of the blouse was nice and maybe if i was taller and ordered a smaller size it would have been better ."

__label__0 "the skirt in person is not like the picture . baggy and runs large . i wear jean size 25 and the xs is two size too loose . there 's no pocket which is surprising on a denim . the slit in front makes the skirt look even loose no shape near what 's in the picture . and there 's no petite sizes . i am going to return it ."

__label__-1 "right out of the bag this top did n't really match the one pictured here ( it is the right top though ) . the fabric was heavy and felt damp -- the way something feels coming out of the wash. very odd . and the fit is nothing like what 's shown on the model . the v is not fitted or nicely wrapped ( or even tacked in place ) -- it was just two loose droopy pieces so most of my bra was showing no matter how many times i put the pieces back where they belonged ( i 'm neither flat chested nor busty"
__label__0 "i loved this top when i saw it online . i was able to go in the store and try it on and sadly it is not the top for me . if you have a large chest then this top will gather at your cleavage and give an awful appearance . the fabric falls in and even the sales associate agreed that it was unsightly . if i were an a or b this probably would have worked . i should have known to stay away from a pleated top ."
__label__0 "this is a really cute shirt . i love the design color and everything about this shirt but the size . i am 5 ' 1 and 105 lbs i can usually wear an xs or xsp . the xs was huge and they were sold out of smaller sizes or i would have ordered one . this unfortunately had to go back ."

__label__-1 "i ordered this dress in a size 8 my normal size at retailer . it is a lovely dress and so feminine but it is incorrectly sized . i could n't begin to button it . i reordered it in size 12 if that tells you anything . buyer beware . unless you are itsy bitsy you need to size up . i will say that as pretty as the photos are the dress is even more lovely in person ."
__label__1 "i got this top in the black and i love it . the bottom is a silky material that 's really beautiful and the cutout details are really pretty . so many of retailer 's sweaters are enormous but this one fits tts . my one complaint is that the bottom white part wrinkles really easily ."
__label__1 "this lovely number met all my expectations . ordered an xl and glad i did . the fabric and styling has flattering drape and it can be dressed up or worn for a casual night out . if it was available in another classic color or a subtle neutral pattern i 'd probably purchase a second one ( hint hint retailer ) ."

__label__1 "this cardigan is utterly gorgeous . way prettier on than i feared . my only issue is it felt a little itchy in the arms and so i finally looked closely at the tag . the tag says the * back * section ( which looks exactly like the weave on the arms ) has a measly 5 % wool snuck into the fabric content . why retailer ? why wool ? i am so sensitive to it ! my eyes have been demon red and itchy all day classic symptoms that led to my getting rid of anything in my wardrobe with wool in it . now i have a problem"

__label__0 "this top is not for a curvy figure . the embroidered part is gorgeous very stunning but the loose bottom part is awful . i am curvy and usually wear l or xl . this top was fitted at the top but very loose at the bottom made me feel like i had a big tummy and was a tad short . i am sending this back . this would look better on a more slender frame ."

__label__1 "the embroidery is breathtaking . it is more flattering and interesting in person . i would highly recommend it ! . it is true to size figure flattering and unique . the only reason i gave it four stars for quality is because the neck is a little itchy . if you are looking for a show stopper and conversation piece this is it !"
__label__1 "i was on the fence about this top because i do n't typically do longer tunic styles . however it really is quite lovely . i paired it with long jeans wedge sandals and a delicate necklace - so pretty ! it fits very nicely and i was surprised at how much i liked the length ."

__label__0 "the material was a little itchy in my opinion . the fit was pretty big . almost a night shirt . i 'm 5 ' 3 and i will probably only wear this around the house with tights . i got a small . i purchased the orange color online . stay away if you have an olive skin tone ! it 's the pinkish it appears to be on be on the website . i 'm 130 pounds 34d"
__label__0 "loved the idea of this top -- but it just wo n't work for me . it 's really big . i 'm 5 ' 3 and 125 lbs . a small should be fine but i 'm swimming in this . the back is pretty ( i tried it on with a white cami ) but it looks very maternity on me . tried to order the xs but it 's sold out . too bad . was a cute idea . not too thin for summer ."
__label__0 "the quality of the fabric is soft and thick and well made . loved everything about it but if you are ample in the chest it is snug and does not hang and drape as well like on the model so you may want to size up . i am sending it back as the fit is not flattering on me for the price . someone with a boyish no-curve figure would look dynamite in it !"

__label__1 "this top is very pretty and looks expensive and as pictured nice pattern and could be dressed up or down the gathered neck is beautiful and has a bit if a stretch however the back of the top has strange bat wing-like design element that seem unnecessary and distract from the elegance of the rest if the top sadly i think i may send it back ."
__label__0 "i bought this shirt with the intentions of using it as a nursing top . to that effect i 'm happy with the purchase and will get a lot of use out of it . i bought two on blush and one blue at the same time . however i was surprised that the shirt was so open and loose . i thought it was just a deep v-neck but the design actually really opens up once the hook and eye is undone at the top . you are then very exposed there is nothing but an opened front shirt . this is convenient for a nursing mother"
__label__0 "i was really excited to receive this dress but was disappointed that it really was n't that special . i 'm 134 lbs 5 ' 5 and i ordered a regular size s and it did fit . i prefer my dresses right above my knees but this was probably 2 inches above the knees . it just was n't that flattering nor worth the price . i expected to be wowed but was n't !"
__label__1 "some reviewers found this skirt to be on the smaller side but for me it was big too bad the smaller size is sold out ( well all peittes are sold out ) . the length is also pretty long below the knee but in the narrow part still ... so able to keep it . the colors are great . i brought it in the store to try on in front fo the stylists adn they all loved it and told me to keep it ... winner for sure !"
__label__0 "i was in love with the green print so i ordered this despite the reviews . i wish i 'd listened . the fit is incredibly weird -- huge at the top but tapering in at the hips . so sad this did n't work ."
__label__1 "these pants are so comfy and perfectly casual without being sloppy . they 're the perfect summer pants ."
__label__1 "while this top does fit very loose it is very cute and can be relaxed or you can dress it up . it is shorter in the front and longer in the back which makes the shirt take on a flattering look . i bought the green color and it is a very rich color it will be perfect for fall ! you may consider ordering a size down if your regular size tends to fit loose ."
__label__1 "i tried this on at the store in the regular size it came in and thought maybe it has some potential is i ordered it for me in a petite since that 's what i am . i ignored the package when i first got it thinking it would n't really look right but omg it 's 100 % amazing and flattering . wear it with skinny jeans leggings jeggings whatever and it 's just super awesome on dressed up or down . i 'd buy this over and over again without a doubt ."
__label__1 "this top is such a great color and style . i did have to go a size down as i typically wear a medium . the style is very forgiving . it looks great with shorts and jeans ! it 's staple !"
__label__-1 "loved the idea of this - unfortunately it disappointed all around . it 's way too short and ran small . the fuzzy collar was also different than pictured in the stock photo and looked a bit tacky and cheap . the pricepoint is also way off the mark for this piece . usually an retailer small ( 57 140 lbs 32dd ) but ordered a medium ( small would not have fit in this piece ) . do not recommend ."
__label__1 "this dress is light airy easy and comfortable to wear . i love the colors and pattern . it looks wonderful with or without a belt . i sized down from a 6 to a 4. i position the front of the dress material closer to the neck so it flows longer at the back . although i am a size 6 the under slip fits perfectly in a size 4. i prefer the dress without a belt but it also looks good with a belt or a jacket or long cardigan . this dress is a keeper !"
__label__1 "this . an unexpected purchase ... i found this on my way to the dressing room . the fit is stunning . i sized way down ( i.e . normally wear 10/12 curvy and bought a small ) . it accentuates my curves and is incredibly flattering . i bought the navy and will be adding another color soon ! the material is viscose blend - soft and flowy . it 's a nice addition to my work wardrobe ."
__label__0 "the dress is great for pear shapes . however i do feel it runs larger than typical retailer sizing . ordered a small ( 5 ' 8 140 # ) and i still think it may be a bit big . the material is very comfortable not too thick or thin . however i feel the shaping on the bottom is a little bulky due to the fabric . see the attached photo ."
__label__1 "this is a great tunic for those of us who like to wear leggings as pants once in a while it covers all the important parts without being too baggy . i found the fabric to be light and comfortable but heavy enough that a light colored bra ca n't be seen underneath with it great if you do n't feel like wearing multiple layers ."
__label__-1 "i disagree with other reviewers on this . it looks a lot better in picture on the model . i found it to run large and not fit in the most flattering way . fabric feels great . i want to love it but it is going back ."
__label__0 "i really love this top but am afraid i may need to return it because the fabric is so delicate that little snags began to show up within hours of wearing it and they show really badly as black spots because the fabric is made with light and dark delicate threads . it feels so good on though ! you must be super careful with it . i have no idea how the little snags even got there !"
__label__1 "fun versatile top for casual wear with capris denim or shorts/skirts . purchased both striped versions . love ballet necklines . the 3/4 length sleeve is wonderful for spring summer fall in california . the top is fitted yet it runs small . be sure to sized up . i normally wear xs however this was way too tight . so i 've ordered a small in both . hoping it works perfectly ."
__label__0 "finally a pretty maeve shirt that actually fit my ( apparently ) giant hulk arms .. but it 's so flowy/swingy i had to return it . this might just be a problem with being a larger lady but the excess fabric made me feel like i was wearing a tent and made me look 10x bigger than i was around my waist/hips even when balanced out with leggings . i thought about trying to size down but was n't sure if that would even solve the excess fabric problem and still leave room in the arms . of course i ca n't try"
__label__-1 "i saw this dress worn on the street and thought it was lovely the perfect work dress . i then found it in the store and my size was already sold out so i visited another retailer and another to find it . unfortunately the color blocking on the chest was not very flattering for me it seemed to overly accentuate it . i am 5 ' 9 a 36 dd size 12. the colors the fabric are all wonderful . but this dress is not for me ."
__label__-1 "the bottom part of this romper is easy to put on but the top is very poorly designed . it needs a zipper at the side or less of a yoke along the back . you have to wrangle your limbs in somehow and i was afraid it might tear . once i got it on it fit perfectly though . getting out of it was a disaster . i had to ask a saleswoman for help and was so afraid it might rip . overall i was crushed that it did n't work out because the print is super cute and it is very flattering ."

__label__0 "this is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house . i 'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it 's a bit scratchy around the edges . i was going to buy another color if i loved this but as it is i will keep the one"
__label__1 "this was a winner retailer ! ! ! ! ! bought it with my birthday discount . a bit pricey but when i wore it ( over and over again ) i can see why . the material is so soft flows beautifully and is just the right length on me . i am petite ( 5 ' 3 ) slender at 115 and i wear it with wedge heels just like the model . i did iron it when i took it out of the package but have not had to iron it again . i have received many compliments on this dress . bought the washed denim look . thank you ! ! ! !"

__label__0 "i really wanted to love this top when i got it but not so much . it fit nicely through the bust and torso but flared out way too much it ended up looking like a maternity top . maybe because i am more of an hourglass shape . another thing it was very low cut i would not have been able to wear this without a cami underneath . the fabric did n't seem to be the best quality it also had a funny smell too it when i took it out of the package . this shirt was not worth the price . sadly this was a mis"
__label__-1 "i so wanted to love this top . i ordered the blue which is blue and orange . i thought the orange would be brighter it is not . it is a dull color . also i 'm usually a medium this top fits fine on my shoulders/bust 34c but it was huge around the waist making me look a lot larger . if this top were a bit smaller around the waist i would keep it but it is going back ."
__label__1 "this chemise is very pretty in person . when i tried it on i was surprised to find that it looks more like a sundress than a chemise . the material is kind of thin but if you wear a nude colored bra underneath it it wo n't show . it looked super cute with a denim jacket on . i took my normal size s and it fits perfectly ( for reference i am 5 ' 2 34b 120lbs ) . i am very happy with this purchase and i ca n't wear it as a chemise a coverup or a hot day sundress . highly recommended !"
__label__0 "this is a cute dress not real form fitting and made of a thin but comfortable jersey material . little see thru and kind of sexy though if you have cute lingerie ."
__label__1 "this is the most intricate delicate beautiful dress i have seen in a long time ! the pale blue coppery brown and dark purple tones are so complimentary of fair skin dark hair and light eyes . unfortunately my normal size was far too snug especially on my hips and this is now sold out . the fabric has no give so i would say with any curves size up if you can find this beauty . i 'm heartbroken to be returning it !"
__label__-1 "great color soft fabric but waaaaay too long . more like a night shirt than a t-shirt ."
__label__0 "nice fabric very versatile but the knit top and style accentuates your bust . probably not an issue for most but if your a d or up it 's more attention than you may want ."
__label__1 "this is a really nice fitting sweater knit skirt . the knit is soft and comfortable heavy enough to smooth out some bumps but definitely shows your curves . i got medium and it 's a little snug at the waist ( i 'm about 29-1/2 ) but not so much to return it and it fits the rest of me great . the only thing i wish was that they 'd made the slip full length it only goes about mid-thigh and sometimes when i get up the slip stays up while the skirt falls right but not a big negative ."
__label__-1 "i was really excited when i ordered this dress for na upcoming beach vacation but was very disappointed when i finally saw it in person . it reminded me of those christmas nightgowns from the 90s with the red and white ruffles . pass !"
__label__1 "love this jacket . it is quite stylish and comfortable at the same time . i was surprised at how affordable it was . my only complaint is that it could wash you out if you have pale skin and get the peach color ."
__label__1 "great shirt more of a stretch to it than i thought it would . very flowy looks great with jeans & leggings ."
__label__1 "i just bought this in the yellow and am very pleased ! ! ! the sleeves are super long but i 'm happy about that ! usually they are much too short this is much cozier ! this will look cute over dresses and with jeans and a longer/tunic style top . nice quality too"
__label__-1 "first of all mine arrived in a regular denim shade not the dark wash shown . also the style is more like a blazer and it was huge . i am 5 ' 2 and ordered the petite xs but even xxs would have looked like a baggy blazer . as well the sleeves came barely past my wrists they are designed to cuff as the model has done ? perhaps on someone taller and younger it would look edgy and chic ! the quality is excellent with some nice details . this might be one to try in person if you can ."
__label__1 "the design and colors on this sweater arguably make it a statement sweater . it has a modified raglan type sleeve . i found the sleeves to fit just fine . for reference i am 5 ' 9 150 lbs . 34dddd and the medium fit perfectly . it is not a long sweater and with my height i wear a long tank top or cami underneath . i love the way it looks ."
__label__1 "this vest is the one thing i will wear all year round . i could n't wait for this to arrive it looks and fits just like the pictures . great quality and value is very stylish and adds a little flair to a simple top and jeans outfit . i have worn it several times and in addition to looking great does keep you warm ."
__label__-1 "just not as long as in the picture . it hit me at my hips not good !"
__label__1 "i have to agree with another reviewer that this runs slightly small . i 'm 5 ' 8 an athletic pear with narrow shoulders 34c and usually a 6 in tops at retailer . since the top looks a little short on the model i sized up to an 8 since i 'd rather have it be flowy and a little longer . i 'm very glad i did because it hits at my low hip and if it were any smaller it 'd be too tight in my chest . since it does n't stretch you need some space for your arms to move . if i could do it again i 'd actually si"
__label__1 "the perfect pair . i am 5 ' 6 . 130lb and ordered size 28 and it fits just right . it is a little stretchy so molds to your shape . the legs are slender but not too fitted . no stitching along the seems makes these jeans classy enough to work with a dressy shirt ."
__label__0 "i tried this jacket on and it was definitely cute but a couple things to note . it 's a wool acrylic blend and it was already starting to pill from being tried on in the store . also it 's unlined . i thought the price point was high given its fibers and unlined . given its hem i wonder how much longevity the piece has and how quickly it might start to look dated too ."
__label__0 "like the color and romper style . this runs extremely large . i am normally a petite small and it was too large . with the wide- leg style and overall length you may need to alter this piece ."
__label__0 "i so wanted to keep this sweater but the invisible metallic threads that give the sweater its crinkled appearance are super scratchy and irritating . it definitely requires a long sleeved top to prevent the irritation as shown in the online photo . it is lightweight and i planned to wear it over sleeveless summer tops/dresses . i have averaged size arms and there was plenty of upper arm room . in fact extra room is designed into the sleeves . one plus for those with upper arm fit concerns . the lower"
__label__-1 "super soft fabric however very short in the stride . i ordered an xl normally wear 12/14 . i had to return it ."
__label__-1 "i love the color of this dress . it is not flattering even though it should be . the weird panels of different materials makes it hang super funky . the lace is heavy but the silky panels are n't . so not flattering it 's just odd . and the fit is super huge you are swimming in it in addition to a poor body drape . it could have been so cute but was executed so poorly ."
__label__0 "looks so beautiful .... on a hanger . does not really do anything on a person . beautiful beading but the dress on is very sack-like . i will be returning it"
__label__-1 "after washing this top pilled terribly . it is beautiful but only for one use ."

__label__-1 "the sweater was nice but not as long as on the model . it was itchy also . this sweater was not what i had expected . their was nothing exceptional about it to spend that kind of hard earned cash sorry retailer . i sent it back ."
__label__0 "very attractive pattern and color . the black is so soft that it seems close to sepia . the length was fine . the fabric meaning the dress is quite heavy for not having a lining except just around the bra area -- -even though the facing did n't successfully substitute for a bra in my opinion . the arm holes are cut in quite a bit so one would have to find the appropriate bra . the dress runs very large . i ordered an xs petite . it was about 2 inches too large ( 4 inches total ) on either side across the"

__label__1 "i love this dress ! i was actually able to fit in a l versus my usual xl due to the style of the dress . a bigger chest person ( i 'm a d ) may not find the dress as well fitting as i do . overall great fit can easily dress it warm with a scarf boots hat or best . a great dress for fall-spring"

__label__-1 "this ran a bit small ; i 'm normally a 2 this was a 4 and 'just ' fit . the pattern was very 'digi ' the length was shorter than i hoped ( i 'm 5 ' 1 ) and the fabric while structured was just cheap and acrylic-feeling . pass ."
__label__-1 "this would have been cute if it was more fitted . i am 5 ' 7 and 125 lbs and the small was too wide . i did n't try the xs because the small was almost too short in the sleeves and so was the length ."
__label__0 "this is a super cute tunic - it is simply way too big ."
__label__1 "i just ordered this dress in blue on sale and it was such a bargain for the quality and look . it 's a very comfortable dress that swings and flatters my body type which is tall and thin . i think this dress would not work on a more busty woman 's frame but it definitely works for me . i 'm 5 ' 9 and 135 pounds and a small is plenty big ( i often take a medium ) . i definitely recommend this dress ."
__label__1 "these pants are great . i am 5 ' 6 and 133lbs . i normally wear medium for athletic bottoms . medium fits well except knee pit area . maybe because they are not very stretching fabric . however they are still flattering . the material was thick enough and their print hides underwear lines ."
__label__0 "i did n't fall in love with this jacket but it was comfortable and seems like it has potential to be flattering on many body types . for reference i tried on a medium and my measurements are 38-30-40 ."
__label__-1 "this is one of those you can tell from the hanger that it 's not going to work . too boxy . too short . and the girlish ruffle makes it look like an over-sized child 's shirt that got all messed up in the washing machine ."
__label__1 "love this top ! ! i bought it for school and im dying to wear it . i could see how other people could dislike it bc of the loose frame but if you like flowy shirts this top is for you ! i like how the shirt is made of a really soft and sturdy cotton and the top part is more fitted so the fabric doesnt completely drown you out . also this top looks super cute paired w/ a bralette and espadrilles !"
__label__-1 "just piping in here -- ordered my usual size of small petite . the slip that came with the dress is about a size negative zero it could hardly squeeze over my body and the dress itself is a bright pale aqua and it is a shift . and because of the smocking it hangs very strangely . i think it looks very cheap and is ill fitting . i would say if you are a person on which shift dresses look awesome you might like this but mind the size of the slip in the petites range and also it is aqua ."
__label__0 "dress runs very large . quality is great and the pockets are a great addition ."
__label__-1 "this is a very slimming well-made nice fitting top-i just disliked the colors . they did not look good on me . otherwise this is a very nice piece !"
__label__1 "i saw this online and then at the retailer store where i was able to try it on and was happily surprised.yes it is way oversized but if you size down it will work best . i have narrow hips and shoulders but a 34 dd bust so fit is not always easy . because of my shape i normally wear a medium or small but had to size down to an xs petite in this . you may find as i did that it works dressed up or down . if i had bought a regular size and were lots younger it could have worked for a dress with tigh"

__label__1 "love to just throw on this shirt with whatever accessories and skinny jeans . easy to wear and very comfortable"
__label__-1 "the shirt is cute but there is no way that the length posted on the website is correct -- it 's a crop top . this was returned ."
__label__1 "this is a very nice jacket in a pretty textured fabric . it seems to fit tts and the cut is very flattering . however - the white is actually ivory . not a big deal unless you were trying to match an outfit with pure white in it . still on the fence about whether to keep it or not ."
__label__1 "i picked this up in the store during the retailer weekend sale . i used to have a similar long black stretchy skirt that i wore until it fell apart . things i really like about this skirt are that it 's basic black but has some interest in the small swiss dots in the top layer and it 's stretchy . the yoga-pant-waistband seems like it will be very comfy and also allows you to adjust the skirt length a little bit depending on whether/how much you fold it down . it is lined which is a big plus . i was"

__label__0 "so comfortable and soft but starting pilling after one wear ! sending back ."
__label__1 "i love the print of this dress ; the deep blue really is striking . i agree with the other reviewers that it has no lining and therefore it 's hard to justify the price . i ca n't seem to part with it yet due to the lovely print and the off the shoulder style is romantic and flattering . still on the fence . . . it would be better as a sale piece ."
__label__-1 "this dress turned out to be a huge disappointment ! ! ! i was in loveee with the picture ! in real life not so much . the material felt thin and cheap ! and the yellow was super yellow ! nothing like the picture . i was so bummed ! returned it earlier today ..."

__label__0 "i was really excited to get this top but unfortunately its going to have to go back . i am 5 ' 6 120 and usually a s fits . however this was really tight . also the material is really really thin for the $ 90 price-tag . save yourself some money and avoid this one ."
__label__0 "drawn to the colors i tried on the top in my regular size m. fyi : 36c broad shoulders/back short waist size 10/12 or l in fitted tops this top is a cropped even for my short-waisted body . i would have to wear a cami under . this is not just because of the cropped length ( top rides up w/ any movement ) but the burn-out velvet is quite sheer . the top is full so it easily exposes with any movement . the back of slides up too . the quality is an issue with exposed threads and irregular seams ."
__label__1 "i own another pair of this brand and these are just as cute and fit the same . i wish the fabric was a bit nice but they still are super cute . they have wider leg holes which are flattering on my muscular build . nice and lightweight and sooooo comfy !"
__label__0 "this is such a cute design but it 's so short ! it barely hits at my hips . you 'd have to wear a layer under it to keep your tummy from being exposed . i 'm also not thrilled with the buttons - i am a 34c bra size and the second button was gaping open on the size 4 top . i wish they 'd been sewn shut - the neckline is so big it 's not like the buttons need to function . i got the burgundy with pink flowers and the colors are great . too bad it 's so short and gapes open at the bust . going back ."
__label__1 "this yellow/mango color is so beautiful in person . i actually do n't have the best skin tone for shades of yellow but i could n't resist trying this one on & it turned out to be perfect ! the silhouette is very feminine especially around the neckline & shoulders . there is a lot of fabric but i actually appreciate that the dress is substantive . finally the nicest thing is that the dress can easily be dressed up or dressed down depending on how you accessorize it . looking forward to summer !"
__label__0 "love the knit color texture -- but oddly a short and boxy fit ... and so ... not flattering ."
