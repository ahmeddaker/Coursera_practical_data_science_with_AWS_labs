-1,Very sheer inexpensive material. even on sale i'm returning it,Blouses
-1,Like the previous review said  i was excited to receive this top. i had grand visions of all the ways i could wear it! to my chagrin  when i put it on  it just fell right down and pooled around my waist. i wish there were smaller sizes to order. sadly  this is going back.,Blouses
-1,I don't have a large head but i could barely squeeze this blouse over mine. i also ordered the xs even though i'm usually a small and it was still blousier than i would have liked. already returned it. on the plus side  it's gorgeous.,Blouses
-1,I bought this top in the store  which was good because i ended up wearing a size smaller than i usually do. i loved the flowy fit of it. the washing instructions say machine wash cold  tumble dry low. i washed it on cold and hung it to dry. it shrank to the point of being unwearable (the dreaded button gap!) and lost its softness. i hope the store lets me return it.,Blouses
-1,Really wanted to love...but...the way it fit..lower part a tad too flowy...almost maternity like to hide a belly and the top area feels like my chest is being smushed! despite my bra size being a modest 36b...the look it gave was square on top almost block like with bottom that had flare...such a pretty top unfortunately the overall design just didn't work me.,Blouses
-1,Unfortunately this one is going back. the fit is very flattering and the underlying layer is very revealing in the back.,Blouses
-1,I love good  flowy blouses and like the over sized look  but this one didn't wow me. i thought the quality was just ok. it didn't flatter me. i almost liked it  but i didn't. i'm glad i tried it on  because looking at the pics online i thought i'd like it way more than i did. just not great.,Blouses
-1,Loved this shirt when i saw the picture. unfortunately fit was not what it needed to be to keep it. you can't really see in the photo but if you have any chest at all (i am only 34b...so would say of average size bust) this shirt will not fit well. there is a seam in the bust area that cuts across the bust which is not flattering/doesn't fit well . the sleeves were also a bit more tight than i'd have thought from the photo.  really wanted to love this - but unless you have a smaller chest it lik,Blouses
-1,Fits like a maternity top. not for my age group or build.,Blouses
0,It is a proper fitting oversized shirt. however  it is very flimsy and even see-through as a summer weight shirt. i returned it because i don't want to wear a tank or cami under it during hot weather.,Blouses
0,This model looks like a bauble head. she is absolutely too thin and sends the wrong message out to retailer shoppers. this last catalog's models are anorexic and unhealthy looking.    i ordered this shirt hoping it would fit  but it's too small for 34dd. i am tall athletic and have breasts.   i think of my shape as average - and the top didn't fit. it's cut narrow and small.,Blouses
0,"I'm 5'9"" and 155lb. i have been wearing small a but this was realllllly small especially at my arms. it made me look like i was taking off... much more beautiful on the model. a medium would e been too big on my torso. the color is amazing! made my blonde hair really pop. i don't love green but this was so different.  would love to find something else in this color that suits me! you need to be a super skinny waif to look good in this!",Blouses
0,I love the design of this blouse and the pattern  but the colors are a bit darker than in the photo. the quality is pretty poor. i feel like its a snag away from being ruined and thrown away and for this price it is just not worth the purchase. sending it back :(   it comes with a tank top; just to let others know.,Blouses
0,Saw this tunic on line and when it was immediately sold out i thought it had to be a winner. after several days of trolling on line the 2p was finally back in stock. now comes the disappointment. yes  the material is sheer but would be a nice weight for humid summer days. the front looked exactly like the model. cut with high side slits that truly made this a tunic. the back of this tunic is some sort of origami design. the fabric bunches out at the butt area. it's bad when you're standing and i,Blouses
0,I love the cut and aesthetic of this shirt  but the fabric unfortunately shows even the slightest hint of sweat  which makes it difficult to wear without being self conscious,Blouses
0,I ordered this top because i liked the look in the back  however  the top i received looks nothing like the back. online it shows that the back has elastic & is gathered. also online it shows thin straps (that look like a bra strap) but my top has no thin straps & no elastic~ extremely odd!! i called customer service but the lady i spoke to didn't have any information or complaints about the top. i'm holding on to the top because it is cute from the front  but i was really wanting the back to lo,Blouses
0,A pretty blouse but the polyester fabric makes it incredibly warm and uncomfortable on after a while. had to return it.,Blouses
0,The fit was fine  but the fabric (the beige option) was bland. it washed me out. granted  i'm fair skinned  but it reminded me of sour milk. it's getting returned.,Blouses
1,Wasn't sure whether i would like the top from the online picture  but it is so much more flattering in person. can be worn as a casual piece with denim skinnys or dressed up with a pencil skirt.,Blouses
1,Perfect trans top.  skinnies or boyfriend and booties.  love the mixed prints,Blouses
1,"Loved the look of the blouse online but the one i received has weird pattern placement that i'm not a fan of. mine was mostly cut from the ""mum/sunflower"" patterned fabric and none of the pretty teal and red pattern. the shirt online as a good combo of patterns-- mine is a solid mrs. roper-all-over-flower print! way overboard!! that said-- the cut is cute and the yoke at the back is a nice detail-- hoping i can exchange it for one that looks more like the online pic!",Blouses
1,I ordered the medium  my usual size for flowing tops. it fits nicely  looks amazing from the front and looks slimming. then i turned to the side and oh my...my boobs protruded like two big balloons. i looked like wonder woman. there was plenty of fabric and it was billowy so it wasn't the size just the cut. i do have 34 g's but what the heck? the color is glorious but it has to go back.,Blouses
1,A must for every closet. very flattering fit - although i think the white is slightly boxier than the chambray.,Blouses
1,I ordered this in an xl and when i pulled it out of the bag  it seemed huge. (i wear both l and xl  depending on the sizing) when i tried it  it did look like the photo - it's meant to be a little voluminous. the arms were a little snug  so sizing down was out of the question. it looks great tucked in to a pair of flair jeans. i gave the asthetic four stars because of the design  which is just a teeny bit off. the lace is delicate too  btw  so care will be needed not to snag it.,Blouses
1,Although this is an online only  i was lucky enough to stumble along a return in the store. this is the same quality and soft fabric that i expect from tyhlo. it doesn't show as much in the model photos  but this top has a subtle high-low effect  which adds a bit of elegance to the top.    i took my usual size xs in the tyhlo brand. however  note that i am small busted (~34b/c) and this was already starting to pull some across the chest. my biggest critique it that this pulling caused a small ga,Blouses
1,I am always on the hunt for a white shirt that is not too sheer  so that i can wear it without a cami underneath. on that count  this top is a winner! regarding the fit  it is a shorter top  so i am not sure that it would be able to be tucked in a bottom for most people. i am short waisted  and i wouldn't be able to tuck it in. in fact  i think it is really meant to have an almost cropped fit. fyi: 36c (34d)  broad shoulders/back  short waist - in a fitted shirt i take a 10/12  but i tried this,Blouses
1,This top does look as pictured  the sleeves hit me the same and the size was true... i just didn't like it... it was shorter than i wanted in length and i just didn't feel like this top was worth the price so it's going back. i feel like i have had shirts with this texture and over time  they just didn't wear as well so i was afraid with 3 kids it wouldn't be a good idea. i paired it with a blazer and it looked great  but on it's on  i don't know  just not for me. for reference  i am 5'8'' 128lb,Blouses
-1,"This could seriously fit a large and it's an xs. so frustrating!! this is the fourth retailer dress that is ordered that is just enormous. i get the whole ""loose fit"" style  but seriously??? you've taken it to a whole new level  retailer!!! another trip to the store to return another item. a complete waste of my time. ugh.",Dresses
-1,Awful color  horribly wrinkled and just a mess...so disappointed,Dresses
-1,I am 5 '5 and 119 pounds with an athletic cury body type. the dress wore bulky and ran large at size 2.,Dresses
-1,The dress didn't meet my expectations  specifically the color  the texture  and the cut of the dress. although the dress was very well made  it just wasn't right for me.,Dresses
-1,"This dress did not work well on my figure. i have a small waist and broad hips  and the dress (size m for 140 lbs  5'8"") was too boxy. i didn't have objections to the fabric  like other reviewers - honestly  even if there were a snag or two  the fabric is kind of rustic and i don't think a snag would look terrible  depending on where it is. i should note that one of the ornamental buttons immediately fell off the dress upon arrival. my friend got the same dress in a size s and it worked better f",Dresses
-1,"This is a really nice quality dress. it is a low-cut v-neck but the fabric is form fitting so its not revealing when u move. i love the top part of the dress but the skirt just did nothing for me. it's a soft material but the skirt almost resembles a bath towel in look and feel. i am petite in size (5'0"" 100lbs). i will be returning due to the skirt being to loose on me in width rather than length. also  the center pleat of the skirt makes it look a bit odd. the skirt hit right at knee height.",Dresses
-1,I read all the reviews about the fabric being see through  but liked the dress enough to give it a shot. it is soooo see through. this trally could only be worn on a beach. very disappointed.,Dresses
-1,"At 5'4""  i guess i am just too short to pull this dress off! the colors are so pretty for summer  but there is just too much fabric... i felt like i was wearing a giant doily! however  there is not a doubt in my mind that taller girls would look fabulous in this!",Dresses
-1,Looks much nicer in the photo. i expected a much higher quality fabric. this fabric truly felt cheap. i expected a nicer dress for the price. the fit was unflattering on me. sent it back,Dresses
0,Super soft  super cute but too short for a dress  too long and too overwhelming for a shirt  and didn't like the look with leggings at all so sadly i'm returning. love the colors  feel and style but no way will sizing up or down fit in a way that was functional...having said that..fits tts i guess.,Dresses
0,I just tried on this dress in the store  in red  and i loved the off the shoulder design. the color is just as pictured online (a light poppy red). the neckline began a few inches below my collarbone and was super flattering. however  the skirt portion of this dress flared awkwardly at the hips  causing my hips to look much wider than they really are (and also disturbing the otherwise clean lines of the dress). it seemed to me that there was too much fabric at the back portion of the skirt than,Dresses
0,Cute dress but not for me.  the waist is too high and the sleeves are tight.  maybe on a different body type this dress would be perfect.  i returned it.,Dresses
0,I love how different this dress is in terms of the design. it catches light beautifully. the short  biased hem makes the dress fun and flirty. but  this dress is completely sheer. there is no lining which is very disappointing. i do have a short  nude slip that makes this dress work for me. you will need a slip  for sure! unless you are rhianna. the sizing runs a little large  i probably could size down given the loose cut but overall the proportions are flattering showing off my legs. i will re,Dresses
0,The fit is really flattering and cute but the fabric and finishings seem really cheap. it's a printed plaid - not woven.,Dresses
0,I love the colors in this dress  it's very feminine. however  i wish it came in petite because even the xs is too overwhelming on my frame.,Dresses
0,"There isn't much shape to this dress. it's fairly straight from top to bottom. i'm smaller on top with a small waist but slightly pear shaped. the top half was somewhat loose but the bottom half just clung too much. i'm 5'2"" and 107 lbs and bought a pxs for reference. also  i wore a tee shirt underneath and the dress shed all over it.",Dresses
0,I ordered the red version--it is incredibly cute  soft  vibrant  and a flattering a-line. however  this dress is sized oddly  running at least one or two sizes too small  particularly at the waistband. i ordered my usual size and one size up  and even the larger size was too snug in the waist.  yet at the same time  i had some gaping at the straps  and i have a full bust. even worse is the *impossible* side-zipper that is a workout to get past the seam at the waistband. trying to wrestle the zip,Dresses
0,"This dress has great potential. i happen to have a longer torso so the fit was off. as a previous review stated  it's short waisted and a lot a skirt which i agree  the hem is also funky. i am still deciding if i want to keep it  but if i do  i plan on altering the skirt to be narrower and hemming it a bit shorter too. for reference  i'm 5'3"" and weigh 110 and i purchased a size 0.",Dresses
1,Gorgeous blush color  soft flowing material made for a perfect outdoor summer wedding guest dress. the elastic around the waist could have been slightly tighter as the dress is a bit weighted but not loose enough to deter my purchase. i'm curvy and this dress was very flattering. i'm on the shorter side and didn't buy the petite (it wasn't available in store and i bought this the day before the wedding); i had to pick up the dress to walk up steps but was fine otherwise in 2 inch heels. i receiv,Dresses

1,This dress will be perfect for the mid-september wedding i'm attending. september is a transitional month fashion-wise and this knit dress will be perfect. the shimmer (which isn't apparent from the website) makes it festive enough for a wedding.,Dresses
1,I just bought this dress in the store and i absolutely love it except for one thing. why are the sleeves on the actual dress so much shorter than the picture with the model? i suspect the model has long arms  not little t-rex arms  so why does the sleeve hit at the top of her wrist  while my lovely dress hits just past my elbow. it's a mystery. was the pictured item not what the store took delivery of? anyway  still a great dress  just trying to figure out if i should add lace or something to ma,Dresses
1,This is one of my favorite retailer dresses - it's flowy and makes me feel beautiful. i loved it so much that i bought it in two colors! it does run big  so i would size down but when you find your size  you'll love it!,Dresses
1,Beautiful dress! beautiful color and design. as the other reviewer says  it has an expose good quality gold color zipper on the back that doesn't show in the picture  however  it adds to its style and beauty! i love the dress and so happy that found it in my size finally!,Dresses
1,This dress is even more beautiful in person. it fits true to size and drapes nicely from the body without being tent-like  as some swing dresses are prone to be. the material is very nice and the pattern is stunning and unique. as someone else mentioned  you can pair this with a cardi for work. it's also perfect for a night out. it's easily dressed up or down. and looks amazing with a skinny belt. i'm happy i bought this one!,Dresses
1,The fabric is breathtaking  both the jewel tone colors and the burnt velvet that would flatter any skin tone. as usual  eva franco clothes run small so i went up a size  size regular 6 (i am 5ft2in  34b  26 waist  36 hips) fit well  the hem is below my knees  appropriate for work. but i think it would look better as a skirt or a sheath dress. the top part looks strange  does not enhance any curve and turns the dress to frumpy on short folks like me  thus one star off.,Dresses
-1,Did not work for me. material was a bit thin  poor quality  the tie doesn't quite work correctly. had a cheaper look to it. not the quality i'd normally expect. this is going back.,Fine gauge
-1,"This sweater is a cute design but did not work for me. i am 5'9"" and this is way to short/cropped and looks awkward. the quality was so so  it looked stretched out in the front. it's getting returned.",Fine gauge
-1,Runs small. arms very short and hits in the wrong place across your chest. would not recommend.,Fine gauge
-1,I wanted this sweater to work but sadly it failed. first  the pink was way to sheer for my liking. the sheerness caused a weird color overlap on the stomach area. then the band at the bottom was too tight causing a weird ballooning affect. a shirt underneath could work but it takes away from the beauty of the knit. the soft pink is gorgeous but not good for medium to light skinned folks.,Fine gauge

-1,"I had this in my cart for a week before i took the plunge  because i thought it would make the cutest boho statement piece that could go from beach to casual evening outings. i'm 5'9""  so i got the m/l to ensure length. maybe that was wrong? if the ""laid flat width"" was included maybe that would have been more helpful  but this thing was massive and looked like a potato sack. the side slits (of course hidden in the photos) came up to just over my natural waist  enhancing that effect. i loved the",Fine gauge

-1,I wanted to love this sweater. the lavender color and design with the pleated back was beautiful. however when i put it on  it added at least 20 pounds to my frame. unfortunately it's going back since the cut just doesn't work on my frame.,Fine gauge

0,Let me start by saying that i cannot wear wool. it doesn't matter what type it is or if it is combined with cashmere  it makes me itch so much that i just can't do it and i didn't not find this as itchy as others stated. that being said  you definitely need to size down. i am a standard small and purchased the xs and there is still a load of fabric. i still don't know what to think. i think it is okay but i am not sure it justifies the price point.,Fine gauge
0,I believe that this sweater is by moth and not knitted and knotted as noted in the description. for me  this tunic was just ok. i didn't think that the quality was great and it just didn't wow me  especially at this price point.,Fine gauge
0,This top is pretty and i'm sad it didn't work out for me. i'm 5'9  145 lbs and i found it to be short and boxy in the torso (tried on a s  m and l). also material in the front is super staticky - i hate that feeling.,Fine gauge

1,Very comfortable sweater. the material is very soft and not itchy at all. i had the hardest time deciding between sizes. the medium was slightly longer and loose through the arms. a bit of a boxy shape. the small was slightly more fitted through the arms and instead of hanging straight had a slight fit and flare look to it but still loose. ended up going with a small since it was less boxy. it's a sweater that can look more put together or more laid back just depending on sizing but overall love,Fine gauge

0,If your hips are bigger than a size 6 us you can't fully close this robe. the model must be wearing the larger of the two sizes to have such a nice oversized fit. the fabric is soft and lux and amazing  but the weird dart in the back and the closure is right over my sadly size 8 hips and butt. if i was taller and thinner i would have kept this and worn it every day.,Intimates

1,I was so excited to receive this in the mail. it fits true to size and is extremely flattering. so glad that i made this purchase,Intimates
-1,The color is completely off! i loved the way this vest looks in the picture! i was excited to have that vest but unfortunately what i received in the mail was a huge disappointment. it came wrinkled and the brown is not as rich as it is in the picture. very pale. horrible.,Jackets
-1,Read the reviews and thought i would just remove the label asap to prevent snags since i loved the item!   however  the item came with unrepairable holes  not just snags and they are either on the neck or front sleeve which forces me to return the item asap. didn't even try it on. so sad  but i still love retailer!!!,Jackets
-1,This is a beautiful vest. i love the color-blocking  the modern and structured style  and its versatility.  i bought it with a defective item discount because there were some stains. i promptly took it to the dry cleaners and was informed that the black would bleed onto the white paneling if they did a full wash. they spot-cleaned it  and it did bleed. although the tag says to dry clean this baby  the black dye will bleed to the white fabric. i'll be taking it back into the store today for a ref,Jackets

-1,The colors on this kimono are amazing and i really loved it  however  i too noticed the 'delicateness' of the material. it is so delicate that parts were starting to fray - including next to the kimono's label. so sad.,Jackets
-1,Love the jacket! so versatile! would probably order up a size if you like a loose fit.,Jackets
-1,I do not understand all the great reviews but that goes to show everyone likes different things! the jacket looks great in the pictures but in person  it just looks awful! gray is one of my favorite colors but this color is so drab and the material looks old and worn. it definitely has a grunge look to it and overall  it is just a wrinkly mess. another reviewer said it looks like old clothes and i have to agree. it looks very shabby. it also reminds me of those smocks they have at the hair salon,Jackets
-1,I purchased this jacket in my local store. size 10 and runs really small . i love the color combination and design but the fabric in my opinion is poor quality. i have seen a lot of retailer use this poly spun knit in so much of their items and the jacket after bringing it home and looking in the light was already showing pilling. looks like it is worn in an bad way. returned the next day. this was a big disappointment and every time i see this fabric being used in retailer clothes it makes me mad.,Jackets
-1,The button fell off when i took it out of the bag  and i noticed that all of the thread had unraveled. will be returning :-(,Jackets
0,"I agree with a previous reviewer who said that it was very nicely cut  but unfortunately  the materials are so cheap. the ""fleece"" material that it is made out of feels like the cheap polyester fleece blankets that you get at the discount stores. it will pill easily  and is noticeable even in the dark color. i must have gotten one shipped straight from the store  and it was already starting to do some gnarly pilling. i do love the cut of it  but i can't justify keeping it because this won't last",Jackets
0,The blazer is boxy and less dressy that it seemed online. i could only really wear this in casual situations  and i was hoping to be able to wear it to work as well. it does have an interesting hemline. the shoulders are a bit too narrow for me (but i do have shoulders on the broader side). i don't hate it  but i don't love it either  but it is interesting enough that i'm going to keep it. i ordered a small.,Jackets
0,I ordered two of these  the grey and ivory. i have had great luck with jackets and blazers from retailer. these were the exception. i just could not pull them off. the quality was great but they had little shape except being a bit boxy. i do have wider hips. maybe these would look better on someone tall and thin? for reference  i am 5'6 and about 138lbs. i ordered smalls and the sizing was perfect for me  the style was just off. i had to return both.,Jackets

0,Should have ordered the xl instead of the large. didn't even come close to being able to button the front but i'm a 34 g. i find sanctuary to run small. beautiful soft green color  fabric is soft too. it is cropped to the waist. decided to return instead of reorder.,Jackets

1,"Great jacket for night time in the south this time of year ... very nice fabric  great classic style with a little twist... love retailerplogy ... being an older female  sometimes things can look boring ....i love to dress in fun clothes ... finding something that will work for all ages and that is a ""little out side the lines "" is very nice!!!!",Jackets
1,"Denim  faux fur  flannel... hooray! i absolutely love this jacket and i'll wear it all winter (even under my warmer winter coat). i'm 5'6""/130 and usually a 2-4 in retailer and the small in this coat was plenty big in the waist/chest and even had room underneath to add a second shirt or light sweater. it seems a little shorter on me than in the photo... maybe that's the only drawback.",Jackets
1,Many thanks to all previous reviewers that convinced me to try this blazer. i bought it in navy and it is absolutely perfect. i love its simple lines  softness  and quality of the material. it transitions easily from work to casual. i paired it with mirabella lace top and skinny jeans for a look that is both practical and beautiful.,Jackets
1,I bought this jacket recently and i actually had been watching it in my retailer. store  but  they didn&#39;t have my size.  someone must have returned a size small and i scooped it up.  i probably would have bought the xs but  it was gone.  i went with it a little oversized and love it!  great quality and workmanship on the embroidery.   more like the items that retailer used to sell in 2004 and 2005!  super cute  love it!,Jackets
1,As other reviewers have pointed out  this jacket is way prettier in person than it is in the photos. i can wear it with just about anything. the fabric is soft and lightweight  and drapes really nicely. my only complaint is the photos make the taupe jacket look like it has just a hint of peach/mauve  but in person it's a pretty standard beige. i would have liked that hint of color.,Jackets
1,"This is my first demin jacket ever as all the ones i ever tried were too stiff  and far too boxy and long on me. i need to thank all the reviewers who helped me take the plunge. . got the size xs regular which is only slightly snug at bust when buttoned and a tiny bit long in the arm for me (5'2""  currently 33-25-37 with narrow shoulders and torso). very flattering look. if this jacket comes out in a new darker wash version i will definitely also try a petite size s. . the one i got in the mail",Jackets
1,I first saw this jacket hanging at the store and it didn't look very cute. i saw it again on sale so i decided to try it on. i'm so glad i did! the inside gray material is so soft. i have broad shoulders and this jacket did not hinder my arms at all. it is very comfortable. i bought the x-small and was very surprised at how roomy it was. the sleeves are a tad bit long but the gray inner lining has an elastic cuff so it can be pushed up. not sure if the xx-small would've been too small or if the,Jackets
-1,So disappointed. bought these in a 29 and should've gone with a 28. they're super cute - i got the green. the fit is off. like the other reviews  they stretch out way too much. i would return these but have already washed them. they wash terribly  too. there are weird fading marks all over  even when washed in cold water like the tag states. so disappointed that i spent my gift card from christmas on these. i've been a loyal retailer customer for years and this is the first time i've been severely,Jeans
-1,I ordered these leggings and loved them  for about an hour- at which point the belt loop ripped off of the pant  leaving a hole. i called customer service and they sent me a 2nd pair. same thing happened. i never even pulled on the belt loop. they are just so flimsy. it's a shame bc they are cool looking.,Jeans
-1,I have other stevies  and these are nothing like them. the quality is very synthetic to a point that the material is shiny. the pants themselves run very small in the waist  approx. two sizes too small compared with other stevies. additionally  the cuff is sewn like that in place  and hits at an odd spot if you are taller or have strong calves. see how it gapes in the cuff on the model? like  a rounded bottom? that is way more emphasized in real life. buyer beware!,Jeans
-1,These pants were wonderful...for 2 seasons. yes  for almost $200 a pop they don't even last a full year! loved them so much  i bit the bullet & bought 4 pair. all 4 started to rip in the same spot! i tried to contact ag directly & they do not back up their products after 30 days. fortunately  retailer was wonderful (as always!) i will buy pilcro from now on - much better product for the money.,Jeans
-1,I generally don't spend this much on jeans but wanted a nice black pair so rolled the dice during the sale. who can wear these? i'm an average size 12 and struggled to get these size 32s over my hips  buttoned and zipped. i looked like a stuffed black sausage. best for thin frames and even then  size up.,Jeans
-1,I really wanted to love these  i bought them in a rush because i needed to replace my skinny jeans asap. they were a little long and didn't quite hug my calves but i figured with hemming they would be fine. i was told they wouldn't stretch out much. well  they fit great at the waist but the legs are now huge on me and i can't get them to shrink. wish i spent a little more on a different skinny jean. too late to return  so my hoping to be going out jeans are now lazy day jeans.,Jeans
-1,I really wanted to like these  but they just didn't look right on my 5'3 sorta bulky frame. i have big thighs and always feel out of place wearing leggings  so maybe i'm just not the right target for these  but they looked so cute and i wanted to give them a try. the waist was too high for my liking  and the leg openings were too big and gave me a stumpified look.,Jeans
-1,These are way oversized! i have several pairs of pilcro jeans and these run way too large. wasted money on shipping. won't do that again:(,Jeans
-1,"The color says red but it's more like a rust. i'm 5'3"" so it was long and would need to be tailored and the fabric is so thin i was afraid it would rip if it got caught on anything.    finally returned it without it making it out the door :(",Jeans
0,"I wear a typical 25 in coh jeans and i ordered these in a 25. they fit but they feel more like jeggings than skinny jeans. the wash isn't as faded out as in the picture. and at 5'2"" the rip is right at my kneecap. i bought these for the distressed wash  and will probably return this pair as it looks darker and less faded in person. i look nothing like the model does in this pair of jeans.",Jeans

0,"Fit and style very nice. returned because way too long and bottom detail interfered with hemming. they were at least 4"" too long. i am 5'8"" so heels would fix the issue but i don't want to wear them with a comfy pair of pants.",Jeans
0,I still have mixed feelings about this pants. the fabric is nice  soft and flows well. the fit is good  i ordered 30  could have gone with 29  not a big deal. the one thing that is off is the length - i am 5.7 and these come right to above my ankle...nowhere close to how they sit on the model. the issue with this length is that is neither here nor there  too short for regular pant length and too long for crops. i will probably have to hem them a bit  which is a disappointment when you pay so muc,Jeans
0,Absolutely love these pants! i have had these pilcos for about two months now and it has been a staple in my fall wardrobe. i have worn them at least once a week. the only downfall is the button has already fallen off and the seam in the knee has recently torn apart. given the leather  i'm not sure if they can be fixed. these are fabulous  but the quality is just not there. very disappointing.,Jeans
0,I have a love/hate relationship with these jeans. when i first put them on  i felt like i had finally found my favorite pair of jeans. everything about how they fit and looked was just perfect - and they were offered in a petite size! but then two hours later they were sagging. the fabric is so cozy  but it just stretches too much  too fast. i am not willing to give up yet  so i ordered another pair in a smaller size. i'm less than thrilled about having to shell out the $$ for two pairs  but i r,Jeans
0,I'm 5'2 and 105 lbs; normally a size 25 petite for most jean brands but learned after receiving my online purchase that these jeans run large. i exchanged them for a size 24 petite and thought they fit okay at first but after testing them around the house  they kept stretching and i felt like they were going to fall off my waist! didn't want to wear a belt with these because it distracted from the relaxed style. sadly had to return my purchase.,Jeans
0,They are beautiful! they fit amazingly! they ripped on a seam the third time i wore them. i kept wearing them  because again  the fit! the style! alas  about the fifth time i wore them  the other leg ripped at the knee seam. they are just totally falling apart. it's so very sad. i would wear them alllll the time if they could bear it. i'm actually thinking of buying another pair because i love them soooo  but it would likely be wasted cash as i believe there is a real manufacturing issue here. w,Jeans
0,I really liked these jeans initially  but by the end of the day the waist is really baggy. the fabric stretches with wear and takes a wash to get back to its original shape.,Jeans
1,Great fit and style. the color is perfect for spring  they have a nautical feel to them.,Jeans
1,Normally a 28  and on a fluke i dragged the 27 to the fitting room. the 27 hung better that the 28.  i have a belly  but not much in the hips  so this was surprising. most things are too tight in the waist.  denim feels very soft. they may not last  but it's like butter.,Jeans
1,I just purchased these jeans on-line in my regular petite size 27 (27-35-116lbs) as that's the size i almost always order but ended up exchanging them for the next size up and found the 28's to feel much more comfortable so i'd suggest sizing up one size. the jeans run a bit tight in the thigh and waist area and though i could also get away with wearing the 27's  i just personally prefer the fit of the 28's better. these jeans give a nice shape in the back  are super soft and are the same color,Jeans
1,These jeans are soooo soft. fit is great and the wash is a unique inky grayish color. perfect for fall. love.,Jeans
1,These ultra-slimming jeans are so comfy. the rise is a little higher than i am used to but it covers those little muffin tops perfectly. the color is very dark - almost black which adds to the slimming effect. i have really long legs and these have a little extra at the bottom  which is great. you could wear with flats  booties  boots - just about any type of shoes. these are my new favorite jeans.,Jeans
1,I love these jeans! i came on here to see if they were here on sale  and they are but alas  not in my size. i probably wear these three times per week - to work  going out with friends  all over. i got the gray and i would say the color on the site is true to how they look in person. i bought mine in the store and i will say that i've been on the fence about whether they're gray or purple but the site says gray. if you want a true gray that is a more blue-ish gray  then these are not it because,Jeans
1,I loved the look of these jeans-super cute-however they were way too tight! i ordered my usual size 31. they don't fit like a darker pair of serif jeans i own. back they go ! i'd be curious if anyone else found these to run smaller.,Jeans
1,I felt like i was taking a risk by ordering these without trying them on  but i am so happy i did. they are soft and solid without being thick or stiff. incredibly comfortable. i have a larger hip and booty and these fit great. no grabbing at all and without making the top too big or loose.,Jeans
1,"These cords are so soft and snug on- like a hug for your lower half! i appreciate their lack of stretch: they don't seem to ""bag out"" like other cords can. i like that the fabric is soft but the shape is more stiff. the grey is slightly lighter/more silvery in real life than the picture depicts. for ref  i'm 5'2"" and 103lbs and i bought the 24p.",Jeans

-1,This looked so odd on me! i decided to give it to someone with a different body type and she found it really odd too. the sleeve are a bit too long to be short and they are tight at the bottom. the top is really large  as to be unflattering. perhaps it's just that it doesn't work on someone who is petite  but this one is a return.,Knits
-1,This top is very soft and well made. for my short and curvy figure  it is very unflattering. i considered altering it  but there is no way to do it. it gapes in the front and if you have a waist at all  it won't show because this top is boxy and full in that area. if you are tall and slim  it might be perfect  so give it a try.,Knits
-1,I was extremely disappointed with the quality of this product. as soon as i put this tunic  the right tie loop detached from the garment. i could return it but the point of shopping online was to avoid the hassle of going to the store. the price of the item does not justify the low quality of the final product.,Knits
-1,I have had this shirt for a little over a month. i've wore it maybe 3-5 times and there is a small hole in the middle of the sleeve on my shoulder. it's not even on a seam  so i can't fix it. i expect much better quality from retailer. don't buy this. the quality is very disappointing. which is really unfortunate because this is a very nice fitting shirt and goes well with pencil skirts.,Knits
-1,I really wanted to love this shirt. the fit was great  and the fabric just felt beautiful. luxurious  soft and flowing. but the collar was frayed... in addition  the little keyhole area fabric also had to be carefully handled to make it look smooth and not like bad workmanship. i put it aside to return it  then this morning went to have another look at it  wanting to talk myself back into it. but i can't overlook the fact i'd be ordering a new shirt that would look time-worn. it may be only this,Knits

-1,I am so sad i have to return these leggings. they're adorable--so much so that my fiancã© commented favorably on them--but as other reviewers have pointed out  there's no elastic or string in the waistband so you have to walk around holding them up with one hand or they'll fall down! why  sleeping on snow? whyyyyyyyyyyy? they're so great otherwise!,Legwear

0,I really like the look of these socks  and have become obsessed we over-the-knee socks for winter this year. they are very tick which is nice for keeping warm and for durability for a long lasting product. my only complaint is that they are very difficult to get over the knee. this can be a great thing  because they certainly do stay put-which is a huge problem with over-the-knee socks. however  by the end of the day i was pretty sure i was going to lose a leg from poor circulation.  i am still,Legwear

0,"I do not love these pants. while the fabric is nice  they make me look rather dumpy. i highly recommend the essential taper pant instead  which has beautiful tapering legs and made me look more slender. these pants make me look like i've put on 20 pounds and they also make me look rather squat. perhaps they would look good on someone tall  but at 5' 6"" these are a miss for me!",Pants
0,"The material and construction of the pants are great  but the length is just plain awkward. i'm 5'4"" and the regular came to just above my ankles  and looked as though they had shrunk in the wash in a really bad way. a couple of inches longer and they would've been fine  or i could've gotten them in petite and worn them as true ankle-length pants  but the regular just didn't do it for me. also i'm usually a size 6 (5'4""  125lbs) and these were a little baggy around the waist and hips.",Pants
0,These pants are really beautiful. the material feels nice and i love the pull on style  however  they are much too long for me. i'm 5'3 and they literally hang to my ankles which is not at all flattering like the photos. i think if you are tall enough  these are a wonderful piece.,Pants

0,I love these. the color and the style. but they are once again too short. they are not 33 inches. i need 32 inches to go to the floor. these are above the floor so they are not 33 inches. very disappointing.,Pants
1,These cropped pants are very light weight and super cute. they seem to run just a bit small (i sized up one size from my usual) and don't seem to stretch so a size larger than you generally take may be necessary. the thin pin stripe design is very light in color so they are quite versatile.,Pants

1,This is an awesome piece and i got many complements while wearing it! it is that rare combo of super comfortable yet amazing look all in one. it does run a bit big  especially on top but the stride is short so i had to keep my regular size or i would have had a wedgie all night.,Pants
1,These pants are so cute and flattering. the linen is substantial and the quality of the tailoring is very good. i typically wear a 26p  but they were sold out in the gray color  so i tried the 25p and they fit perfectly. this tells me that they run just a little big  at least in the petite sizing. i wish the rose color was available in petite. i am considering ordering the chocolate as well.,Pants

1,"The photo of these is truly misleading - they are a beautiful vibrant print - see the close-up photo. they are much longer on a regular person - they come a few inches above my ankle and i am 5'5""there is a neat slit off to the side on the front of each (like a pleat) that really allows a nice flow. these look great with boots  flats and do sit lower on the waste as i think they run slightly large. not lined  but drape beautifully. there are pockets (sewn closed upon purchase) and pack pockets.",Pants
-1,"I followed the other reviews and sized down. normally  i'm a small/medium in retailer (5'8""/135 for clarification) and i expected the garment to be a bit roomy. i ordered the small and when it arrived i almost called the corporate office to ensure i didn't have to pay rent on the romper  given that you could comfortably fit a small family of five in it. oddly  the arm-holes were normal sized? i returned this mess.",Shorts
-1,Looked really cute on the hanger  so i took it with me into the dressing room. the fabric is super soft  and the top is very flattering however the bottom is way too short! you can't tell from the picture but the sides are rounded and go up higher on your leg. the model has the waist band pulled lower than i think you'd most likely be wearing it making the outfit appear longer. i wish i could pull this off...maybe i'm just too old for it.,Shorts

-1,I was disappointed when i got this romper in the mail. the picture looks much cuter than in person. although it's true to size  it looks pretty baggy on. also  i thought the grey (top) and blue (bottom) were too similarly colored; more contrast would have been nice. i'm returning this item.,Shorts

-1,I loved this romper so much! the material is thin  but perfect for summer. the style is just what i was looking for. it's so so cute and fit perfectly...at first. i wore it one time and then washed it exactly as described on the tag and it shrunk beyond recognition. it went from loose and flowy  like on the model  to little booty shorts and a body suit...not the look i was going for. i am so disappointed.,Shorts
-1,I love the material on these shorts. unfortunately  that's all i love. the fit is awkward and i'm an easy fit. they're boxy in the body / legs and a bit tight in the waist  causing me to not be sure whether to place the elastic waist higher or lower and neither one works well. sadly  couldn't keep these just for the pretty fabric.,Shorts
0,"I'm 5'4""  130 lbs  curvy and fit. i'm usually a size 6 but when i tried these shorts on  they were tight. i sized up to an 8 and they looked better. but overall the fit was not flattering on a petite  curvy frame. i think these shorts would work on someone taller and a bit thinner in the thigh area.",Shorts
0,I am so sad that this romper didn't work out. it's just way too billowy and huge. i am usually between a small and medium so i ordered this small. i'm petite and somewhat curvy and i was absolutely swimming in this romper! might look best on taller girls. i am 5 '2 and about 125-130 lbs and this was like wearing a tent. do not recommend. such a bummer because i was a believer after treading all of the great reviews!,Shorts
0,These are so cute and the colors are great  however  they stretch out about 2 sizes. they fit me perfectly and i sized down and they stretched out about a size 1/2 to 2 sizes too big. i'm bummed out because they are perfect in every other way. didn't think they would stretch out as much as they did. and they look awful once  they've stretched out. wish i didn't take the tags off or i would have returned them. size down at  least one size  i could have sized down two sizes. hoping they shrink lik,Shorts
0,I had a few pairs of these high-waisted beauties last year and love them so i was thrilled to see them in this adorable pattern which is even cuter in person. unfortunately  the cut is different. the sides  covered here by the model's hands  flare out a bit which is the function of the sectioning that the piping accentuates. the top is not the definitively high-wasted height from last year. i don't own anything else high-wasted  being an apple i'm generally a low-rider owing to a small hips/butt,Shorts
0,These looked so cute and colorful! very sad to receive them yesterday and having to return them today. cute overall  but run large. depending on cut/style  i range from 2-4 in bottoms. i ordered a 2 in these  and they were just way too big. i would exchange for a zero  but i bought them for a trip this weekend. oh well.... consequence of online shopping!,Shorts
0,These shorts are just beautiful. with that said  they were expensive  but made reasonable when i snagged them in the online sale! they do also run large  and they seem to be made for short-waisted bodies. i will be bringing them back to my local store to (hopefully) exchange for a smaller size. fingers crossed that they still have them in stock!,Shorts

0,The fabric is super soft and comfortable and the look is cute  however the drape on the front crossover is not great and doesn't flatter well. the shorts will probably run a little on the short side for some - i'm very short (5') and the length is great for me but i'm guessing not for the average height.,Shorts
0,This romper is extremely well made and the colors are even more beautiful in person.  however  i found it to run extremely short in the torso.  i couldn't get my arms through the sleeves after stepping into it without ripping the garment.  for reference i'm 5'9 with a slightly longer than average torso.  i ordered my normal size m.,Shorts

1,These shorts are great  both the design and fit are beautiful. i would say that these run true to size  i bought my usual size  26  and they fit perfectly. they fit a little high waisted  which i love. the material is so soft and are so comfortable. i would recommend these shorts if you're thinking about it!,Shorts
1,It's really not in my typical wheelhouse. i took a chance based on reviews. the shorts are long and roomy enough. and i love it with the long-sleeves. i somehow feel less exposed in it than i thought i would. i do agree with the comment that the material feels pretty flimsy for the price point. that's a bummer.,Shorts
1,These shorts are comfortable and are just the right length. i have the blue and it isn't as bright as shown in the pictures  but it's a great color nonetheless that coordinates well with many wardrobe items. when i tried on my usual 25  i found the waist fit a bit snug so i bought the 26 for a comfortable fit. i should've stayed with my usual size though  because after wearing for an entire day  the shorts loosened up quite a bit and developed a saggy look to them. i'm so disappointed with this,Shorts
1,I tried on this romper when it was still full price and loved it  but wasn't sure i wanted to splurge at the time. at the new sale price this romper is definitely worth it for the quality and style. i am 5'2''/103lbs and the xs fits pretty well  but truthfully an xxs would have been better if it existed. the top part of the romper (above the waist) is a bit long--- the waistband hits maybe an inch or 2 below my natural waist  but perhaps this can be tailored. overall very happy with this purchas,Shorts
1,"First let me say that i've recently fallen in love with the pilcro brand. i love the pilcro hyphen chinos and needed some new shorts for the summer. i have extremely muscular legs and have a hard time finding shorts that look good. i was hesitant to try these on because they said the inseam is 4"" but one other reviewer pointed out that they are a good mid-length if you unroll them  so i just went to try them on at the store  and what do you know? they are exactly that! unrolled  they come about",Shorts

-1,I really loved this skirt on the model  but it just wasn't flattering when i received my order. i ordered two sizes - 2 and 4. i am 5'4  athletic build and the front closure made my waist look much larger than it is. the back of the skirt also flared out more than i expected it to.     sadly  i had to return both. perhaps this would look better on someone with a much taller frame.,Skirts

-1,I agree with the other reviewers that this runs big. unfortunately there is nothing smaller than an xs so this is going back. i love the lyocell material  i have another skirt with this material and wanted to love this as well but it is too big and with the drawstring pulled tight to fit it doesn't look right. it is not as pictured as well. the skirt i received is a medium blue denim  not the lovely light blue as pictured  another reason why i am returning.,Skirts
-1,"I am almost always an xs in bottoms (sz 0-2) but literally couldn't get the stretchy waistband (no zip or fastening) in xs up my hips. in addition  the ""brocade"" is a very lightweight polyestery  tinselly weave--does not suggest quality. as others have noted  it also runs short; i'm 5'3'' and this was a little below knee length on me  not ankle-length. i've had luck with retailer's sale section in the past  including some items that didn't always start off with the best reviews  but have no regret",Skirts

-1,"I was so excited about this skirt and pairing it with a cute blouse for the warmer weather. as i took out the skirt out of the package and flipped it around  the back has mesh strips that are see through! there is also no lining to go with this skirt. if you go back to the ""back view"" picture on the website and zoom in closely  you can see the model's black underwear.",Skirts
-1,Had high hopes for this seemingly cute skirt to use as a basic in my spring and summer outfits. however  that was not the case. this skirt is not lined and the material is so so. basically  for the price  i was underwhelmed and will return it.,Skirts
-1,Oh dear. the elastic waistband just ruined this skirt for me--it made it look so cheap. i assumed from the photograph that the skirt was a knit over a structured lining with a real waistband with a zip. instead  it's a sweatshirt knit with no lining and elastic. it looked cheap and hung a bit baggy from the elastic waist  making it a no-go for me.,Skirts
0,Super cute but order at least one size up,Skirts
0,"This picture does not do this skirt justice. it is gorgeous. however  the waist was so small that the sequins dug into my waist making me think of a medieval torture device. unfortunately  it was the largest size so i can't size up. i'm 4'11"" so the length was perfect - it came to right above my knees. i love the skirt so much that i'm considering liposuction.",Skirts
0,"It's such a beautiful skirt  i kept it around and tried it on with every top i own but i could not get the right look. the waist ""poofs"" out right below the waistband so any shirt worn over it makes you look frumpy. tucking a shirt in didn't look right because of the poof. it doesn't do anything to flatter a figure. the skirt itself is gorgeous. for the price  i need to make sure my clothes make me look good too! reluctantly i had to return it. i was hoping it would be my summer go-to skirt.",Skirts
0,First  i was surprised that this skirt fabric felt similar to men's tie.  it is a thick weight silky feel.  next  i was surprised by the cut.... i wear a 12/14 petite  and the waist of the large is at least a size 10 if not smaller.  finally  the length was really long.  i realize i am 5'2 and buying non-petite sizes  but the cut was high ankle on me. i like the pattern and ruffles of fabric  both are unusual and good for fall/winter.  but i did not like the rest.,Skirts
0,This skirt is very pretty but i think it runs very large. i am a size 4  xs in retailer. my waist is 28 inches  5'7  140 pounds. the skirt is touching the floor. even if i wear high heels  i will have to wear it up my waist. the elastic band is weak  not sure if it will hold the skirt. it should be ok with a belt. i still recommend it cause it's so pretty.,Skirts
0,I got this in black. will probably get in the purple print too. the purple is a bit more casual  while the black can be work appropriate if with a nice top. very comfy.,Skirts
0,I love the look and fabric of this skirt. it also falls at a very nice  flattering length around the knee. what did not work for me was the waist. the stretchy waist looked cheap  and i do not have a flat stomach  so it made me look like i have a muffin top! i bet it would look great if you have a flat stomach.,Skirts
0,I am so in love with this skirt  but unfortunately it runs at least one size small...since i am a 16 there is no sizing up. the color  quality  and style are perfection but i would say this runs as more true to junior's sizing than a regular women's size. so sad because it will be going back.,Skirts
0,This is a lot shinier in person  and the elastic band is really tight but i still selected true to size. there is a hi-lo hem going on that doesn't flatter my legs but it looks fantastic from the side. due to the stiffness of the material and the tightness of the band  it can get crumply on the side if you don't get the right size. the material feels a little thin and scratchy.,Skirts
1,This cut and shape of this skirt is very flattering. i am normally a medium but the small fit and looked much better- less bulky. the material is nice almost sweater like but not so heavy. it's a very versatile skirt. highly recommend.,Skirts
1,I didn't like the price tag  but got a good price with a sale  so i splurged! this skirt hugs curves in the nicest  most flattering way without feeling like you have to hold in your belly:) very cute ruched design and soft make it easily dressed up or down. i plan to wear with some bright flats for an upcoming trip  but have the perfect white tennies for casual everyday. love it!!,Skirts
1,I definitely agree with the other reviews  however i really like this skirt because it will go with a variety of tops to dress it up  or down  as well as color options. the tricky thing is that it runs super small. i'm usually between a 6  or 8 (28/29)  and ended up getting a size 10. i don't like high waisted skirts or pants  so it sits just below my navel and is very comfortable. maybe best to try on in store  but worth it!,Skirts

1,Love this skirt. purchased it in a 0 and it fit fairly good. sat high up on the waist  which i like. however  now that i have worn it i should have ordered it in a 2. i think the 2 would have let it sit further down making it not so short. i do recommend this skirt but i would order both your regular size and one size up (0 is my typical size in full skirts).,Skirts
1,This is very cute. it's lined  it's smocked. it's longer on me than the model in the picture. i was a bit concerned about the short length but the skirt actually came to just above my knees  which works well for me. it might run a tad big because it is a pull of skirt. i look forward to wearing this light weight skirt on hot days his summer!!,Skirts

-1,I splurged on this pajama set for myself and now regret it. even though the design is adorable  the fabric contains acrylic and the knitted fairisle part started pilling within the first week of wear. after a month and a couple washes  it looks horrible  and the fleece part is looking a little grungy as well. so so disappointed. the top is intentionally oversized and comes down to my crotch  i could have easily sized down.,Sleep
-1,These are very pretty  but i have had a few problems with them. out of the package  i found them to be true to size. i think i purchased the pxxs or the pxs. however  even though they are machine washable  i feel that they shrunk upon washing and are now too short (i am barely over 5' tall). also  the elastic waistband keeps twisting within the casing  which drives me crazy. i have to keep straightening it. i think there are better options for sleep pants.,Sleep
-1,I gulped when i put this in my bag during retailer days because the price was still too much but thought this has to be wonderful to charge so much  right? boy was i wrong. this is a sweater knit with a very deep v-neck that's incredibly boxy and unattractive. the knit shed all over my pants in the few minutes i had it on. i ordered in xl  having never tried this designer and that was a mistake because i generally wear large or medium. it was swimming on me. the stripes aren't as cute in real life,Sleep

-1,If you are going for a ridiculously high priced ugly sweater contest  this is the one for you. i normally like clothing with some character and juxtaposition  but this one did not do it for me. i cannot imagine the collar fitting right or flattering anyone  and the mixed layers end up making it look cheap rather than trendy.,Sweaters
